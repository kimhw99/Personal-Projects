In the 7th century, a Silla\u2013Tang alliance conquered Baekje in the Baekje\u2013Tang War. Following the Goguryeo\u2013Tang War and Silla\u2013Tang War in the 7th century, Silla annexed the southern part of Goguryeo, unifying the central and southern regions of the Korean peninsula.\nUnified Silla existed during the Northern and Southern States period at a time when Balhae controlled the north of the peninsula. Unified Silla lasted for 267 years until it fell to Goryeo in 935 during the reign of King Gyeongsun.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe people of the Unified Silla period considered themselves to be of a kingdom of unified Koreans, which they called \"\u4e09\u97d3\u4e00\u7d71\", (Modern Hangul: \uc0bc\ud55c\uc77c\ud1b5, Samhan-iltong) meaning the unity of three kingdoms (the three kingdoms being Silla, Goguryeo, and Baekje). The term was used by general Kim Yu-sin, credited with leading many of the military campaigns to unify the Korean peninsula under Silla, in a letter he wrote to King Munmu as he lay dying. King Munmu is considered to have been the first ruler of the Unified Silla period, and subsequent kings continued to hold the perception of a unified Silla, as evidenced by King Sinmun's installment of \"nine counties\" (\u4e5d\u5dde) and \"nine legions\" (\u4e5d\u66f8\u5802). In the ancient Sinosphere, the number nine connoted great things, and ancient China was composed of nine counties as well, so the term \"\u4e5d\u5dde\" was used as a synonym for the entirety of China, as well as for \"all under heaven\" (\u5929\u4e0b). In addition, Silla gave noble ranks to the nobles of Goguryeo and Baekje as a token of unification.\nNorth Korean historians criticize the idea of \"Unified Silla\" as from their perspective, Goryeo was the first state to unify the Korean people as Silla failed to conquer parts of Goguryeo and Balhae in the northeast of the Korean peninsula. Because of this, North Korean historians use the term \"Late Silla\" (\ud6c4\uae30\uc2e0\ub77c) where South Korean historians would use \"Unified Silla\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 660, King Munmu ordered his armies to attack Baekje. General Kim Yu-sin, aided by Tang forces, defeated General Gyebaek and conquered Baekje. In 661, he moved on Goguryeo but was repelled. Silla then fought against the Tang dynasty for nearly a decade.\nDuring its heyday, the country contested with Balhae, a Goguryeo\u2013Mohe kingdom, to the north for supremacy in the region. Throughout its existence, Unified Silla was plagued by intrigue and political turmoil in its newly conquered northern territory, caused by the rebel groups and factions in Baekje and Goguryeo, which eventually led to the Later Three Kingdoms period in the late 9th century.\nGyeongju remained the capital of Silla throughout the whole existence of the dynasty, which demonstrates the power of the governmental system employed in Silla. By using the \u201cBone Clan Class\u201d system, a small group of powerful people (the 'bone clan') was able to rule over a large number of subjects. To maintain this rule over a large number of people for an extensive period of time, it was important for the government to keep the unity of the bone-rank system and hold the governed subjects in a low social status.\nDespite its political instability, Unified Silla was a prosperous country, and its metropolitan capital of Seorabeol (present-day Gyeongju) was the fourth-largest city in the world at the time. Through close ties maintained with the Tang dynasty, Buddhism and Confucianism became the principal philosophical ideologies of the elite as well as the mainstays of the period's architecture and fine arts. Its last king, Gyeongsun, ruled over the state in name only and submitted to Wang Geon of the emerging Goryeo in 935, bringing the Silla dynasty to an end.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Regional administration ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nUnified Silla carried on the maritime prowess of Baekje, which acted like the Phoenicia of medieval East Asia, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea and Japan, most notably during the time of Jang Bogo; in addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River.\nUnified Silla was a golden age of art and culture, as evidenced by the Hwangnyongsa, Seokguram, and Emille Bell. Buddhism flourished during this time, and many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhists and contributed to Chinese Buddhism, including: Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang, and Kim Gyo-gak, a Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.\nUnified Silla and the Tang maintained close ties. This was evidenced by the continual importation of Chinese culture. Many Korean monks went to China to learn about Buddhism. The monk Hyecho went to India to study Buddhism and wrote an account of his travels. Different new sects of Buddhism were introduced by these traveling monks who had studied abroad such as Seon and Pure Land Buddhism.\nUnified Silla conducted a census of all towns' size and population, as well as horses, cows and special products and recorded the data in Minjeongmunseo (\ubbfc\uc815\ubb38\uc11c). The reporting was done by the leader of each town.\nA national Confucian college was established in 682 and around 750 it was renamed the National Confucian University. The university was restricted to the elite aristocracy. However, in Silla society, because the bone-rank system was used for the election of officials rather than the imperial examination process that was used in Confucianism, the National Confucian University did not have great appeal to the nobility class of Silla.\nSilla was very scientifically and technologically advanced for the time. There was an emphasis put on astrology especially as it was closely tied to agriculture. This allowed them to accurately record events such as solar eclipses and lunar eclipses.\n\n\n=== Woodblock printing ===\nWoodblock printing was used to disseminate Buddhist sutras and Confucian works. During a refurbishment of the \"Pagoda That Casts No Shadows\", an ancient print of a Buddhist sutra was discovered. The print is dated to 751 CE and is one of the oldest discovered printed material in the world.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Korea\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nLee, Ki-baik (1984), A New History of Korea, translated by Wagner, Edward W.; Schultz, Edward J., Harvard University Press, ISBN 9780674615762"}}}}
