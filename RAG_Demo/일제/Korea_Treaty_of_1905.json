Negotiations were concluded on November 17, 1905. The treaty deprived Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty and made Korea a protectorate of Imperial Japan. It resulted from Imperial Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBeginning from the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1876, a series of treaties were signed between Korea and Japan throughout the following decades. During the signing of the 1876 Treaty, Joseon Korea actively participated in the negotiation process, with the initial Japanese proposal of a most-favored nation clause ultimately omitted due to Korean demands. However, Japanese demands for compensation after the 1882 Imo Incident led to the signing of the 1883 Treaty of Tax Regulations for the Japanese Trade and the Maritime Customs, which deprived Korea of its tariff autonomy over trade with Japan and gave Japanese nationals most-favored nation priviledges. The Japanese victory over the Qing in the First Sino-Japanese War led to the complete withdrawal of Chinese forces in Korea, further consolidating Japanese influence over the peninsula.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Imperial Japanese forces were dispatched to occupy Seoul. Under Japanese military presence, the Korean government was forced to ratify the Japan\u2013Korea Protocol on February 23, 1904. The protocol stipulated that Japan may occupy and use strategically important locations in Korea to achieve military objectives. In August of the same year, the First Japan\u2013Korea Agreement was signed, which required that the Korean government accept financial and diplomatic advisors dispatched by Imperial Japan. The agreement was utilized by Japan to bolster its exclusive dominance over Korea during the signing of the Taft\u2013Katsura Agreement and the Second Anglo-Japanese Alliance.\n\n\n== Signing of the treaty ==\n\nWith its victory over Russia and the subsequent withdrawal of Russian influence from Korea, Japan sought to deprive the Korean Empire completely of its diplomatic rights and render it a protectorate.  In a 27 October 1905 cabinet meeting, the Japanese government agreed on eight provisions regarding the signing of a second treaty to acquire absolute authority over Korea's foreign affairs. Specifics of the treaty were drafted on a separate document, which was transmitted to Seoul the following day. \nOn 2 November 1905, President of the Privy Council It\u014d Hirobumi was dispatched to Korea as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to lead negotiations. It\u014d arrived in Seoul on 9 November 1905. Accompanied by Deputy Ambassador to the Kingdom of Korea Hayashi Gonsuke, It\u014d delivered a letter from the Emperor of Japan to Gojong, Emperor of Korea, attempting to arrange a meeting with him. However, Gojong initially refused, citing his illness. Gojong acquiesced to It\u014d's demands on 15 November, however, when he ordered Japanese troops to encircle the Korean imperial palace. Throughout their meeting, Gojong and It\u014d argued for over three hours, with Gojong questioning whether the signing of the agreement would render Korea's status into that of the colonized nations of Africa. When It\u014d requested that Gojong order his foreign minister to commence negotiations, he refused, arguing that such matters were subject to the approval of the Korean Privy Council (jungchuwon) via government procedure.\nNegotiations between the Korean cabinet and the Japanese delegates began on the 16th. Seven members of the State Council (Uijeongbu)\u2014Prime Minister Han Kyu-seol, Minister of the Army Yi Geun-taek, Minister of the Interior Yi Ji-yong, Minister of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry Gwon Jung-hyeon, Minister of Finance Min Yeong-gi, Minister of Education Yi Wan-yong, and Minister of Justice Yi Ha-yeong\u2014along with former Prime Minister Shim Sang-hoon, were summoned by It\u014d to his residence, where sessions were held. Deputy Ambassador Hayashi arranged separate negotiations with Minister of Foreign Affairs Pak Chesun in the Japanese legation, where he proposed a rough negotiations agenda. In a separate meeting, however, Gojong and the Korean ministers decided that the agenda would not be submitted to a State Council meeting.\nOn the morning of 17 November, Hayashi once again summoned the Korean ministers to the Japanese legation, where they again refused to sign any agreement in terms of government procedure. Hayashi then proceeded to Jungmyeongjeon hall in Gyeongungung palace with the ministers, where an Imperial Conference (\uc5b4\uc804\ud68c\uc758; \u5fa1\u524d\u6703\u8b70) was held. When the conference once again refused to sign the treaty, Hayashi sent a messenger to It\u014d around 6 in the evening, who was then waiting with Field Marshal Hasegawa Yoshimichi in Daegwanjeong, the headquarters of the Japanese army stationed in Korea. Two hours later, It\u014d and Hasegawa arrived, now accompanied with Japanese military police, at Jungmyeongjeon Hall. It\u014d resumed negotiations and confronted each of the ministers individually, asking their opinion on the agreement. He further pressured the cabinet with the implied, and later stated, threat of bodily harm, to sign the treaty. Han Kyu-seol and Min Yeong-gi expressed explicit objection to the signing of the treaty, while Yi Ha-yeong and Gwon Jung-hyeon expressed a weak opposition. However, the rest of the cabinet reluctantly agreed to the treaty under conditions that minor revisions are made, with Gwon later reversing his stance.\nAccording to \ud55c\uacc4\uc625 (Han-Gyeok), Korean prime minister Han Gyu-seol disagreed, shouting loudly. Ito ordered the guards to lock him in a room and said if he continued screaming, they could kill him. The Korean cabinet signed an agreement that had been prepared by Ito in the Jungmyeongjeon. The Agreement gave Imperial Japan complete responsibility for Korea's foreign affairs, and placed all trade through Korean ports under Imperial Japanese supervision.\n\n\n=== Treaty provisions ===\nThis treaty deprived Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty, in effect making Korea a protectorate of Imperial Japan. As a consequence, the Korean Empire had to close its diplomatic representations abroad, including its short-lived legation in Beijing, and its legation in Washington, D.C.\nThe provisions of the treaty took effect on November 17, 1905, and it laid the foundation for the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1907, and subsequent annexation of Korea in 1910.\nThe treaty was deemed to have gone into effect after it received the signature of five Korean ministers:\n\nMinister of Education Lee Wan-yong (\uc774\uc644\uc6a9; \u674e\u5b8c\u7528)\nMinister of Army Yi Geun-taek (\uc774\uadfc\ud0dd; \u674e\u6839\u6fa4)\nMinister of Interior Yi Ji-yong (\uc774\uc9c0\uc6a9; \u674e\u5740\u9394)\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Park Je-sun (\ubc15\uc81c\uc21c; \u6734\u9f4a\u7d14)\nMinister of Agriculture, Commerce and Industry Gwon Jung-hyeon (\uad8c\uc911\ud604; \u6b0a\u91cd\u986f)\nThese five were later named the \"Five Eulsa Traitors\".\nEmperor Gojong of Korea did not assent or sign the treaty. Other officials who disputed the treaty included:\n\nPrime Minister Han Kyu-seol (\ud55c\uaddc\uc124; \u97d3\u572d\u5368)\nMinister of Finance Min Yeong-gi (\ubbfc\uc601\uae30; \u9594\u6cf3\u7dba)\nMinister of Justice Yi Ha-yeong (\uc774\ud558\uc601; \u674e\u590f\u69ae\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\n\nEmperor Gojong sent personal letters to major heads of state to appeal for their support against the illegal signing. As of February 21, 1908, he had sent 17 letters bearing his imperial seal, to the following eight heads of state:\n\nKing Edward VII of the United Kingdom\nPresident Armand Falli\u00e8res of France\nEmperor Nicholas II of Russia\nEmperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary\nKing Victor Emmanuel III of Italy\nKing Leopold II of Belgium\nEmperor Kuang-hsu (Guangxu) of China\nEmperor Wilhelm II of Germany, which was personally handwritten by Gojong\n\nIn 1907, Emperor Gojong sent three secret emissaries to the second international Hague Peace Convention to protest the unfairness of the Eulsa Treaty. But the great powers of the world refused to allow Korea to take part in the conference.\nNot only the Emperor but other Koreans protested against the Treaty. Jo Byeong-se and Min Yeong-hwan, who were high officials and led resistance against Eulsa treaty, killed themselves as resistance. Local yangbans and commoners joined righteous armies. They were called \"Eulsa Euibyeong\" (\uc744\uc0ac\uc758\ubcd1, \u4e59\u5df3\u7fa9\u5175) meaning \"Righteous army against Eulsa Treaty\".\nAfter completing the treaty, Emperor Gojong tried to let the world know the unfairness of the treaty, including sending a special envoy to The Hague. This directly contributed to the forced retirement of King Gojong.\n\n\n== Rescission ==\n\n\n=== Gojong's declaration of rescission ===\nThereafter, Gojong tried to inform the international community of the injustice of the 2nd Korea-Japan Agreement, but according to the logic of the international situation at the time, Gojong's secrets were not effective. Gojong's declaration of Rescission in the Eulsa Treaty had the following, but it was not recognized internationally:\n\nA national document written on January 29, 1906,\nPersonal letter handed to Special Commissioner Hulbert on June 22, 1906,\nA letter sent to the President of France on June 22, 1906,\nGojong's power of attorney given to the Hague Special Envoy Lee Sang-seol on April 20, 1907, etc.\nThis treaty, later, was confirmed to be \"already null and void\" by the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea concluded in 1965.\nIn a joint statement on June 23, 2005, officials of South Korea and North Korea reiterated their stance that the Eulsa treaty is null and void on a claim of coercion by the Japanese.\nAs of 2010, South Korea was seizing property and other assets from the descendants of people who have been identified as pro-Japanese collaborators (Chinilpa) at the time of the treaty.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the treaty, Japanese influence on Korea dramatically increased. All of the diplomatic mission of Korea was disestablished. All of the foreign relation of Korea was administered by a Japanese Resident-General. It\u014d Hirobumi was appointed as the first Resident-General.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nJapan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1904\nJapan\u2013Korea Agreement of August 1904\nJapan\u2013Korea Agreement of April 1905\nJapan\u2013Korea Agreement of August 1905\nJapan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1907\nJapan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910\nAnglo-Japanese Alliance\nTaft\u2013Katsura Agreement\nTreaty of Portsmouth\nRoot\u2013Takahira Agreement\nUnequal treaty\nLiancourt Rocks\nGovernor-General of Korea\nI Wail Bitterly Today \u2013 famous editorial about the treaty\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBeasley, William G.
