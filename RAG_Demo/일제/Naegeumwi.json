The number of royal guards varied between 60 and 200, at times may have reached 300.\n\n\n== Inspection ceremony ==\nThe monarch held random inspections of the royal guards, with the tolling of the Cheobjong bell(\ucca9\uc885,\u758a\u9418), which notified the guards that the king was approaching Gwanghwamun Gate. The bell could be heard in central Seoul, as well. \nThe guards had to line up in formation and display their combat skills and tactical skills, according to the Owijinbeob (\uc624\uc704\uc9c4\ubc95,\u4e94\u885b\u9663\u6cd5), which was a contemporary document recording various movements and strategies, considered to be the most modern at the time. \nThe royal guards had to defend the east side of the field (the king's left side), during a mock battle with the Gyeomsabok (\uacb8\uc0ac\ubcf5,\u517c\u53f8\u50d5) cavalry units, who would attack from the right (west) side. At the end of the inspection the king would display his displeasure or satisfaction with the skills and performance of the Naegeumwi.\n\n\n== Re-enactments ==\nThe royal guard system was dissolved in 1910. In modern days, re-enactments of the royal guards' inspection ceremony are performed for tourists at the Gyeongbokgung Palace during high season. \n\n\n== See also ==\nWanggung Sumunjang\nJoseon Army\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Naegeumwi at Wikimedia Commons"}}}}
