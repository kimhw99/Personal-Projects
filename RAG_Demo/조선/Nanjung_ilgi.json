It was written between January 1, 1592, and November 17, 1598, a first person narrative of the admiral's perspective on the Japanese invasions of Korea in the late 16th century.\nIt is the 76th national treasure of Korea and listed in UNESCO's Memory of the World registry.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe original Nanjung ilgi consists of 205 folio pages divided into 7 volumes. Entries detail the admiral's daily life in a military camp, his strategies, his naval campaigns, the names and dispositions of various military officers and civil officials with whom Admiral Yi interacted, geographic and atmospheric details, and his personal observations and commentary on the events and circumstances of his military command. These entries are not continuous: there are breaks in the narrative throughout the diary, representative of periods of time in which Admiral Yi was unable to maintain daily entries.
