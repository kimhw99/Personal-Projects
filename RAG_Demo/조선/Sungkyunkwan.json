Today, it sits in its original location, at the south end of the Humanities and Social Sciences Campus of Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea. Twice a year, in May and September, the ceremonial rite Seokjeon Daeje is performed in the Munmyo Shrine, to honor Confucius and the Confucian sages of China and Korea.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSung (Korean: \uc131; Hanja: \u6210; RR: seong) \u2013 accomplish, achieve.

It was renamed, destroyed, and rebuilt several times. In 1895, it was reformed into a modern three-year university. During the colonial era (between 1910 and 1945), Sungkyunkwan was demoted to a private institution and renamed Gyeonghagwon (\uacbd\ud559\uc6d0; \u7d93\u5b78\u9662), while Korean education was prohibited and Japanese education was forced nationwide. After Korea gained independence in 1945, Gyeonghagwon's original name was restored and with funding from Yurim (Confucians) nationwide, Sungkyunkwan University was established.\n\n\n== Design features ==\nThe old campus was designed based on geomancy. Sungkyunkwan was built with the mountains behind it to the north and the front facing south towards water (the Han River and Bansu, the creek that used to run around the front of the campus). This was based on superstition as well as function. The sunlight and wind patterns were considered most ideal when the buildings were arranged this way.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe primary written language of Sungkyunkwan was Hanja. Sungkyunkwan's teachings were mainly Confucian-related, and were primarily aimed at preparing students for government service. Students also studied law, medicine, interpretation, accounting, archery, mathematics, music, and etiquette. But the main goal was for the students to pass the higher national civil service examinations (gwageo). Like their Chinese counterpart, these examinations were on writing ability, knowledge of the Confucian classics, and proposals of management of the state (governance). Technical subjects were also included to appoint experts in medicine, interpretation, accounting, and law. The original set number of students was 150 when Sungkyunkwan was founded, which was raised to 200 in 1429. All of the students were male and women were forbidden from entering the campus.\nEntrance examinations for Sungkyunkwan were extremely harsh and were only allowed for the sons of yangban, the Joseon era upper class or royalty. There were two ways to be accepted into Sungkyunkwan. Either the students had to pass the two admission exams, Saengwonsi (\uc0dd\uc6d0\uc2dc; \u751f\u54e1\u8a66) and Jinsasi (\uc9c4\uc0ac\uc2dc; \u9032\u58eb\u8a66), or take the other two examinations, Seungbo (\uc2b9\ubcf4) and Eumseo. If they passed these examinations, they were given the opportunity to be accepted.\nStudents lived very comfortably on full scholarship and were waited on by servants.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\nYi Gae (1417\u20131456)\nHwang Hui (1363\u20131452)\nCh\u014fng Inji (1396\u20131478)\nChoe Hang (1409\u20131474)\nMunjong of Joseon (1414\u20131452)\nShin Suk-ju (1417\u20131475)\nSejo of Joseon (1414\u20131468)\nKim Chong-jik (1431\u20131492)\nJo Gwang-jo (1482\u20131519)\nYi Hwang (1501\u20131570)\nHyujeong (1520\u20131604)\nYi I (1536\u20131584)\nYu S\u014fngnyong (1542\u20131607)\nKim Jang-saeng (1548\u20131631)\nYun Seon-do (1587\u20131671)\nHeo Mok (1587\u20131682)\nYun Hyu (1617\u20131680)\nGwon Sang-ha (1641\u20131721)\nPark Mun-su (1691\u20131756)\nYeongjo of Joseon (1694\u20131776)\nJeongjo of Joseon (1752\u20131800)\nJeong Yak-yong (1762\u20131836)\nPark Gyu-su (1807\u20131877)\nChoe Ik-hyeon (1833\u20131906)\nKim Ok-gyun (1851\u20131894)\nPark Eun-sik (1859\u20131925)\nYi Dong-nyeong (1869\u20131940)\nShin Chae-ho (1880\u20131936)\nJo So-ang (1887\u20131959)\n\n\n== See also ==\nEducation in the Joseon Dynasty\nHistory of Education\nGukhak\nGukjagam\nSonggyungwan (Kaesong)\nSungkyunkwan University\nBeijing Guozijian\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Sungkyunkwan at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website (in Korean)\nSungkyunkwan University\nMunmyo Korean Tourism Site"}}}}
