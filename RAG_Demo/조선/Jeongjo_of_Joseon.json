He was the second son of Crown Prince Sado and Lady Hyegy\u014fng, and succeeded his grandfather, King Yeongjo, in 1776. \nHis father Crown Prince Sado was executed in 1762, leading to conflicts over Yi San\u2019s legitimacy as heir. As king, he sought to clear his father\u2019s name, balance political factions, and strengthen royal authority. He built the Hwaseong Fortress, reformed governance, and promoted talented scholars. Facing assassination attempts, he created the Changyongyeong royal guards. Jeongjo established the Kyujanggak royal library, expanded social mobility, and encouraged Neo-Confucian scholarship. His reign marked a cultural and political renaissance, but factional struggles persisted. Today, Jeongjo is remembered for his various efforts to reform and improve the nation.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nHe was the son of Crown Prince Sado (who was put to death when Jeongjo was 11 by his father, King Yeongjo) and Lady Hyegy\u014fng (who wrote the Memoirs of Lady Hyegy\u014fng, details her life as the ill-fated Crown Princess of Korea, and as advice and explanations for her grandson about the deaths of his grandfather and so many maternal relatives). His elder brother Crown Prince Uiso died in infancy. His mother Lady Hyegy\u014fng's collection of memoirs serves as a significant source of historical information on the political happenings during the reigns of King Yeongjo (her father-in-law), King Jeongjo (her son), and King Sunjo (her grandson).\nIn 1762, his father, Crown Prince Sado, was executed (by imprisonment in a rice chest) by King Yeongjo (Crown Prince Sado's father and Prince Yi San's grandfather) after long conflicts and Sado's years of mental illness. Crown Prince Sado opposed the ruling Noron party. He started to hate the parties of Joseon. Eight years later Yi San asked to visit Sado's living quarter but his Grandfather King Yeongjo refused. So he refused to attend Crown Prince Sado's funeral. On 21 February 1764, Yi San became the adoptive son of Crown Prince Hyojang and Princess Consort Hyosun by the order of King Yeongjo. Crown Prince Hyojang was the elder half-brother of his father, Crown Prince Sado. Crown Prince Hyojang though, had died during his childhood. King Yeongjo made Yi San a part of Hyojang's family because he was concerned that Yi San, who was Sado's son and successor, would be opposed. The Noron faction protested Yi San's legitimacy as the royal successor under the claim that Yi San was the 'Son of a prisoner' or 'Son of a madman' and thus ineligible to succeed the throne. This was a major source of vexation for King Yeongjo for an extended period.\nAfter 1762 to 1777, some members of Noron attempted to depose Jeongjo for his relation to Crown Prince Sado and open the path of succession for his half-brothers Prince Eunjeon, Prince Euneon and, Prince Eunshin. His grand uncle Hong In-han and Jeong Hu-gyeom, adopted son of Princess Hwawan, were amongst them.\nWhen he was the Crown Prince, King Jeongjo met Hong Guk-yeong (\ud64d\uad6d\uc601; \u6d2a\u570b\u69ae), a controversial politician who first strongly supported Jeongjo's accession and toiled to improve the king's power, but ended up being expelled because of his desire and ambition for power. Another helper was Kim Jong-su (\uae40\uc885\uc218; \u91d1\u937e\u79c0), despite being a member of Noron.\nIn 1775, one year before King Yeongjo's death, King Jeongjo was appointed regent. However, King Yeongjo did not give him any military power.\n\n\n=== Reign ===\nBefore Yeongjo died, Jeongjo had his coronation in Gyeonghuigung on 10 March 1776. After his coronation, Jeongjo chose his spouse. The first thing that Jeongjo said to his officials was that he was the son of Jangjo (temple name of Crown Prince Sado) who was executed by the former king.\nJeongjo tried to empathize with his people. During his second year of reign, a great drought came. During the drought, Jeongjo was nervous just like the people and did a rainmaking ritual for his people. He also was deeply concerned about the continuing outbreaks of measles epidemics, and among other things supplied free public medicines in an attempt curb the death rates.\nConcerned about political factions, Jeongjo continued his grandfather's policy of Tangpyeong (political harmony policy) in an attempt to balance political factions. By this, he tried to get rid of the parties which caused his father's death.\nFrom the first day of the reign, Jeongjo spent much of his reign trying to clear his father's name. One of the first things Jeongjo said following his ascension to the throne of Joseon was declaring that he was the son of Crown Prince Sado. He also moved the court to the city of Suwon to be closer to his father's grave. He built Hwaseong Fortress to guard the tomb. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nJeongjo was always threatened by some of his officials who were against his reign. He was able to overcome these challenges with the help of Hong Guk-yeong and others.\nDuring his accession, he also issued a royal decree that his mother, Lady Hyegy\u014fng, be a Dowager Queen since his father, her husband, was supposed to be the King before him. Thus, she became the Queen Dowager, the widow of Jangjo. From then on, King Jeongjo experienced many turbulent periods, but overcame them with the aid of Hong Guk-yeong, Kim Chong-su.\nIn 1776, Hong Sang-beom, Hong Kye-neung and other some member of Noron unsuccessfully attempted to stage a military coup d'\u00e9tat and assassinate him. Jeongjo fought the rebels who were secretly in royal palace and personally arrested his assassins. Jeongjo executed Hong Sang-beom, Hong Kye-neung, and another some member of Norons, and put to death Prince Eunjeon, Hong In-han, and Chung Hu-kyom.\nJeongjo tried to impeach Hong Guk-yeong in an attempt to stop the concentration of political power in single civil family but the impeachment failed.\nIn 1785 he established Changyongyeong (\uc7a5\uc6a9\uc601; \u58ef\u52c7\u71df) as the King's royal bodyguards. Jeongjo had started selecting officers by competitive examination since 1782 to recruit them into the Changyongyeong unit, to replace the Naekeunwe (corps of Joseon royal bodyguards created by Taejong of Joseon in 1407), which he no longer trusted.\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nKing Jeongjo led the renaissance of Joseon, but was initially busy continuing the policy of Yeongjo's Tangpyeong (\"Magnificent Harmony\"; \u8569\u5e73, \ud0d5\ud3c9) policy of political reconciliation between the parties. He tried to control the politics of the whole nation to advance and further national progress.\nHe made various reforms throughout his reign, notably establishing Kyujanggak (\uaddc\uc7a5\uac01), a royal library. The primary purpose of Kyujanggak was to improve the cultural and political stance of Joseon and to recruit gifted officers to help run the nation. Jeongjo also spearheaded bold new social initiatives, including opening government positions to those who were previously barred because of their social status.\nHe cultivated knowledge of humanities and philosophy (Neo-Confucianism). He was known to be studious and well-read. Among the King's entourage, one that had a great influence and became both a great teacher and father figure for him was Kim Jong-su. Jeongjo also had the support of the many Silhak scholars who favored regal power over the parties, including scholars Jeong Yak-yong, Pak Ji-won, Pak Je-ga and Yu Deuk-gong. His reign also saw the further growth and development of Joseon's popular culture.\nJeongjo favored members of the Soron and Namin party over those of the powerful Noron faction, as a way to establish checks and balances and strengthen royal authority.\nHe was opposed to new fashions in the composition style of Korean writing and personally taught composition to some intellectuals and bureaucrats called Munchebanjong (\ubb38\uccb4\ubc18\uc815 \u6587\u9ad4\u53cd\u6b63 \u2013 literary criticism/reform).\nIn 1791, Jeongjo got a report from Chae Je-gong that the people were having difficulty surviving by selling the fruit of their labor. Jeongjo then established the new law of Shinhae Tonggong (free trade law), which allowed anyone to sell their goods at the market. This abolished the previous law of Gumnanjeonguoun, which reserved this right exclusively to members of merchant groups in the capital.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nIn his final years, Jeongjo arranged for the marriage of his second son and successor Sunjo of Joseon to Lady Kim of the Andong clan, daughter of Kim Jo-sun, but did not live to see his son's marriage. In 1800, Jeongjo died suddenly under uncertain circumstances at the age of 47, without seeing much of his life's work come to fruition under his son, Sunjo. There are many books regarding the mystery behind his death, and speculation as to the cause of his death continues even today.\nHe is buried with his wife, Queen Hyoui, at the royal tomb of Geonneung (\uac74\ub989; \u5065\u9675) in the city of Hwaseong.\nOn 7 December 1899, Jeongjo posthumously became Jeongjo Sanghwangjae.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nBiological father: King Jangjo of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \uc7a5\uc870; 13 February 1735 \u2013 12 July 1762)\nGrandfather: King Yeongjo of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \uc601\uc870; 31 October 1694 \u2013 22 April 1776)\nBiological grandmother: Royal Noble Consort Yeong of the Jeonui Yi clan (\uc601\ube48 \uc774\uc528; 15 August 1696 \u2013 23 August 1764)\nAdoptive grandmother: Queen Jeongseong of the Daegu Seo clan (\uc815\uc131\uc655\ud6c4 \uc11c\uc528; 12 January 1693 \u2013 3 April 1757)\nAdoptive father: King Jinjong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \uc9c4\uc885; 4 April 1719 \u2013 16 December 1728)\nBiological mother: Queen Heongyeong of the Pungsan Hong clan (\ud5cc\uacbd\uc655\ud6c4 \ud64d\uc528; 6 August 1735 \u2013 13 January 1816)\nGrandfather: Hong Bong-han (\ud64d\ubd09\ud55c; 1713\u20131778)\nGrandmother: Lady Yi of the Hansan Yi clan (\ud55c\uc0b0 \uc774\uc528; 1713\u20131755)\nAdoptive mother: Queen Hyosun of the Pungyang Jo clan (\ud6a8\uc21c\uc655\ud6c4 \uc870\uc528; 8 January 1716 \u2013 30 December 1751)\nConsort(s) and their respective issue\n\nQueen Hyoui of the Cheongpung Kim clan (\ud6a8\uc758\uc655\ud6c4 \uae40\uc528; 5 January 1754 \u2013 10 April 1821)\nRoyal Noble Consort Su of the Bannam Park clan (\uc218\ube48 \ubc15\uc528; 1 June 1770 \u2013 6 February 1823)\nCrown Prince Yi Gong (\uc655\uc138\uc790 \uc774\uacf5; 29 July 1790 \u2013 13 December 1834), second son\nPrincess Sukseon (\uc219\uc120\uc639\uc8fc; 1 March 1793 \u2013 7 June 1836), second daughter\nRoyal Noble Consort Ui of the Changnyeong Seong clan (\uc758\ube48 \uc131\uc528; 6 August 1753 \u2013 4 November 1786)\nMiscarriage (8 December 1780)\nMiscarriage (July 1781)\nYi Sun, Crown Prince Munhyo (\ubb38\ud6a8\uc138\uc790 \uc774\uc21c; 13 October 1782 \u2013 6 June 1786), first son\nFirst daughter (20 March \u2013 12 May 1784)\nUnborn child (4 November 1786)\nRoyal Noble Consort Won of the Pungsan Hong clan (\uc6d0\ube48 \ud64d\uc528; 27 May 1766 \u2013 7 May 1779)\nRoyal Noble Consort Hwa of the Namwon Yun clan (\ud654\ube48 \uc724\uc528; 11 April 1765 \u2013 14 January 1824)\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nPortrayed by Kim Yong-gun in the 1989 MBC TV series 500 Years of Joseon Dynasty: Pa Mun.\nPortrayed by Jung Jae-gon in the 2001 MBC TV series Hong Guk-yeong.\nPortrayed by Lee Seo-jin and Park Ji-bin in the 2007 MBC TV series Lee San, Wind of the Palace.\nPortrayed by Ahn Nae-sang in the 2007 KBS2 TV series Conspiracy in the Court.\nPortrayed by Kim Sang-joong and Park Gun-woo in the 2007 CGV TV series Eight Days, Assassination Attempts against King Jeongjo.\nPortrayed by Bae Soo-bin in the 2008 SBS TV series Painter of the Wind.\nPortrayed by Han Myeong-goo in the 2008 film Portrait of a Beauty.\nPortrayed by Jo Sung-ha in the 2010 KBS2 TV series Sungkyunkwan Scandal.\nPortrayed by Hong Jong-hyun in the 2011 SBS TV series Warrior Baek Dong-soo.\nPortrayed by Hyun Bin and Goo Seung-hyun in the 2014 film The Fatal Encounter.\nPortrayed by Lee Je-hoon, Kim Woo-suk, and Kim Dan-yool in the 2014 SBS TV series Secret Door.\nPortrayed by Go Woo-rim in the 2015 KBS2 Drama Special Crimson Moon.\nPortrayed by So Ji-sub and Lee Hyo-je in the 2015 film The Throne.\nPortrayed by Lee Jun-ho and Lee Joo-won in the 2021 MBC TV series The Red Sleeve.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Jeongjo of Joseon at Wikimedia Commons\n(in Korean) King Jeongjo Foundation for Humanities and Act\nOfficial website of Hwaseong Fortress\n\"Introduction.\" A Unique Banchado: The Documentary Painting, with Commentary, of King Jeongjo's Royal Procesion to Hwaseong in 1795, by Han Young-woo and Chung Eunsun, Renaissance Books, Folkestone, 2017, pp. 1\u20136.
