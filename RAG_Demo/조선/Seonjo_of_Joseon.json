He was known for promoting Confucianism and attempting reforms at the beginning of his reign. However, he later gained infamy from the political discord and his incompetent leadership during the Japanese invasions of Korea.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nKing Seonjo was born Yi Yeon in 1552 in Hanseong (today, Seoul), capital of Korea, as the third son of Prince Deokheung (\ub355\ud765\uad70), himself son of King Jungjong and Royal Noble Consort Chang of the Ansan Ahn clan (\ucc3d\ube48 \uc548\uc528). On his mother's side, Yi Yeon was also a great-great-great-grandson of Princess Jeongui, the daughter of Queen Soheon and King Sejong. Princess Jeongui's granddaughter, Lady Ahn of the Juksan Ahn clan, married Jeong Sang-jo (\uc815\uc0c1\uc870; \u912d\u5c19\u7956), his great-grandfather and son of Ch\u014fng Inji through his second wife, Lady Yi of the Gyeongju Yi clan. As well as Jeong Sang-jo being the younger half-brother of Jo Gwang-jo.\nHe was given the title of Prince Haseong, and was eventually adopted by Queen Insun. When King Myeongjong died young without an heir, Prince Haseong was the next in the line of succession. Then, by decision of the royal court, he was crowned king in 1567 at the age of 16. His father had the status of Grand Internal Prince (\ub300\uc6d0\uad70, Daewongun, 'Great Prince of the Court).\n\n\n=== Beginning of reign (1567\u20131575) ===\nAccording to imperial sources, King Seonjo focused on the improvement of the lives of the common people, as well as rebuilding the nation after the political corruption during the chaotic reign of Yeonsangun and King Jungjong. He encouraged Sarim scholars, who had been persecuted by entrenched aristocrats in four different purges between 1498 and 1545 during reign of Yeonsangun and Jungjong. Seonjo continued the political reforms of King Myeongjong, and put many famous Confucian scholars, including Yi Hwang, Yi I, Jeong Cheol, and Yu S\u014fngnyong, in office.\nSeonjo also reformed the civil service examination system, particularly the civil official qualification exam. The previous exam was mainly concerned with literature, not with politics or history. The king himself ordered the system to be reformed by increasing the importance of these other subjects. He also restored the reputations of executed scholars such as Jo Gwang-jo, who died in Third Literati Purge of 1519, and denounced the accomplishments of corrupt aristocrats, notably Nam Gon, who instigated the purge under Jungjong and contributed greatly to the corruption of the era. These acts earned the king the respect of the general populace, and the country enjoyed a brief era of peace.\n\n\n=== Political division and East-West feud (1575\u20131592) ===\n\nAmong the scholars King Seonjo called to the government were Sim Ui-gyeom and Kim Hyowon. Sim was a relative of the queen and heavily conservative. Kim was the leading figure of the new generation of officials and called for liberal reforms. The scholars who supported King Seonjo began to split into two factions, headed by Sim and Kim. Members of the two factions even lived in the same neighborhood; Sim's faction lived on west side of the city while Kim's followers gathered on the east side. Consequently, the two factions began to be called the Western Faction and the Easterners ; this two-faction based political system lasted 200 years and later helped bring about the collapse of the Joseon dynasty.\nAt first the Westerners earned the favor of the king, since Sim was related to the queen and also had larger support from wealthy nobles. However, their attitudes on reformation and Sim's indecisiveness helped the Easterners take power, and the Westerners fell out of favor. Reforms were accelerated during the first period of influence of the Easterners, but then many Easterners began to urge others to slow down the reforms. The Easterners were once again divided into the Northern and the Southern Faction. Yu S\u014fngnyong led the Southern faction while the Northerners divided even further after arguments over many issues; the greater Northern faction came to become extremely liberal in the scope of their reform goals, while the \"lesser\" Northern faction was less reformist but still more open to reform than the Southerners.\nThe political divisions caused the nation to be weakened, since the size of the military was also one of the issues on the reform agenda. Yi I, a neutral conservative, urged the king to increase the size of the army to prepare against future invasions from the Jurchens and Japanese. However, both factions rejected Yi's suggestions, and the size of the army was decreased further since many believed the peaceful period would last. The Jurchens and Japanese used this opportunity to expand their influence in East Asia, resulting in the Seven-Year War, and the foundation of the Qing dynasty in China, both of which would lead to devastation on the Korean Peninsula.\nKing Seonjo faced many difficulties dealing with both new threats, sending many skilled military commanders to the northern front, while contending with Japanese leaders Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu in the south. However, after Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified Japan, the Japanese soon proved themselves to be the greater threat; and many Koreans began to fear that their country would be taken over by the Japanese. Many officials concerned with the defense of the kingdom urged the king to send delegates to Hideyoshi, their major purpose being to find out whether Hideyoshi was preparing for invasion or not. However, the two government factions could not even agree on this issue of national importance; so a compromise was made and one delegate from each faction was sent to Hideyoshi. When they returned to Korea, their reports only caused more controversy and confusion. Hwang Yun-gil, of the Westerners faction, reported that Hideyoshi was raising huge numbers of troops, but Kim Seong-il, of the Easterners faction, told the king that he thought these large forces were not for the war against Korea, since he was trying to complete his reforms quickly to prevent lawlessness and quash the bandits now roaming the countryside. Since the Easterners had the bigger voice in government at the time, Hwang's reports were ignored and Seonjo decided not to prepare for war, even though the attitude of Hideyoshi in his letter to Seonjo clearly showed his interest in the conquest of Asia. The factional infighting of the Joseon court, combined with the 1589 rebellion of Jeong Yeo-rip that led to the purge of more than 1,000 scholars affiliated with the Eastern faction, led to Joseon's unpreparedness against the imminent Japanese invasions.\n\n\n=== Imjin War (1592\u20131598) ===\n\nIn 1591, after the delegates had returned from Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi sent his own delegates to visit King Seonjo, and asked permission to pass through the Korean Peninsula to invade China, in effect declaring war against the Joseon kingdom. The king was surprised; after refusing the Japanese request he sent a letter to Beijing to alert the Chinese that the Japanese were actually preparing for full-scale war against the Korean-Chinese alliance. He also ordered the construction of many forts in the coastal regions and sent generals Sin Rip and Yi Il to the southern coast to prepare for war. While the Koreans were busy making their preparations, the Japanese manufactured muskets for many of their soldiers, mobilized warriors from across the entire country.\nOn April 13, 1592, 700 Japanese ships carrying 18,700 troops under Konishi Yukinaga invaded Korea. Konishi burned Fort Busan and Fort Dongnae, killed commanders Jeong Bal and Song Sang-hyeon and marched northward to Hanyang. On the next day, Kat\u014d Kiyomasa and Kuroda Nagamasa with 22,800 and 11,000 troops respectively landed, also marching toward Hanyang. The Japanese fleet under Todo Takatora and Kuki Yoshitaka supported them from the sea. General Yi Il faced Kat\u014d Kiyomasa at the Battle of Sangju, which was won by the Japanese. Yi Il met up with General Sin Rip and engaged Konishi's troops at the Battle of Chungju, but were defeated. Then Seonjo appointed General Kim Myeong-won as Commander-in-Chief and Field Marshal, and ordered him to defend the capital and moved to Pyongyang as the Japanese began encroaching upon the city. He later moved even further north to the border city of Uiju just before the fall of Pyongyang. While the king was absent from the capital, many people who had lost hope in the government plundered the palace and burned many public buildings, including the Gyeongbokgung. During Seonjo's stay at Uiju, he wrote the Joseon government's first public document written solely in Hangul, rather than Hanja. Historians believe that the king deliberately chose Hangul to ensure commoners could understand the message and to prevent the Japanese from understanding it.\nAlthough the army continued to lose men and battles, the navy under Admiral Yi Sun-sin defeated the Japanese fleet several times and did much damage to the supply ships. With the navy blocking supplies, Ming forces arrived at the request of Seonjo and began to push the Japanese southward, eventually retaking Pyongyang. Konishi Yukinaga successfully blocked a Chinese advance at Battle of Byeokjegwan, and again tried to push the Koreans northward, but the crucial blow came at the Battle of Hangju, where General Gwon Yul defeated the Japanese with a much smaller force. The Japanese then decided to enter into peace negotiations, while both sides continued fighting. A month before he returned to Hanyang, Seonjo wrote an edict in Hangeul where anyone that either captured Japanese forces in battle, reported on invading troop movements, or rescued Korean prisoners would receive the title of government official regardless of class. During these negotiations Korean forces retook Hanseong, but the palaces had all been burnt to the ground, so Seonjo repaired one of the old royal family's houses and renamed it to Deoksugung, making it one of the official palaces.\nThe peace negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese ended unsuccessfully, due to disagreements between the two sides and misrepresentation of the Koreans. The Japanese again invaded Korea in 1597; but this time all three nations were ready for war, and the Japanese were not able to advance as easily as in 1592. The Japanese tried to take Hanyang from both land and sea routes. At first the plan seemed to work well when Todo Takatora defeated Admiral Won Gyun at the Battle of Chilchonryang, but it was eventually thwarted when the Korean navy under Admiral Yi Sun-sin defeated the Japanese fleet under Todo Takatora in the Battle of Myeongnyang with only 13 ships. After the sudden death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1598, the Japanese completely withdrew from Korea in 1598. The ensuing Battle of Noryang marked the end of the war, with the last Japanese units under Konishi Yukinaga leaving Korea.\n\n\n=== Later days (1598\u20131608) ===\nDespite all the efforts put in by Seonjo during the war, such as establishing army training facilities and reforming taxation laws \u2013 which awarded people with increase of social class, exemption of labor or crimes in return for payment of tax in rice \u2013 the war left a devastated land and starving people. After the war, his wish of reconstructing the nation was impeded by the political turmoil caused by quarrelling political factions and famine. His Crown Prince Gwanghaegun aided him in his ruling of the country. However, when the queen gave birth to Grand Prince Yeongchang (Gwanghaegun was the second son of Lady Kim, the king's concubine), the succession also became a matter of contention. King Seonjo died in 1608.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nBiological father: Grand Internal Prince Deokheung (\ub355\ud765\ub300\uc6d0\uad70; 2 April 1530 \u2013 14 June 1559)\nGrandfather: King Jungjong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120 \uc911\uc885; 16 April 1488 \u2013 29 November 1544)\nGrandmother: Royal Noble Consort Chang of the Ansan Ahn clan (\ucc3d\ube48 \uc548\uc528; 2 September 1499 \u2013 7 November 1549)\nAdoptive father: King Myeongjong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120 \uba85\uc885; 3 July 1532 \u2013 2 August 1567)\nBiological mother: Grand Internal Princess Consort Hadong of the Hadong Jeong clan (\ud558\ub3d9\ubd80\ub300\ubd80\uc778 \uc815\uc528; 23 September 1522 \u2013 24 June 1567)\nGrandfather: Jeong Se-ho, Internal Prince Hadong (\ud558\ub3d9\ubd80\uc6d0\uad70 \uc815\uc138\ud638; 1486\u20131563)\nGrandmother: Lady Yi of the Gwangju Yi clan (\uad11\uc8fc \uc774\uc528; 1473 \u2013 ?)\nAdoptive mother: Queen Insun of the Cheongsong Shim clan (\uc778\uc21c\uc655\ud6c4 \uc2ec\uc528; 7 June 1532 \u2013 12 February 1575)\nConsort(s) and their respective issue\n\nQueen Uiin of the Bannam Park clan (\uc758\uc778\uc655\ud6c4 \ubc15\uc528; 15 May 1555 \u2013 26 July 1600)\nQueen Inmok of the Yeonan Kim clan (\uc778\ubaa9\uc655\ud6c4 \uae40\uc528; 5 December 1584 \u2013 3 August 1632)\nPrincess Jeongmyeong (\uc815\uba85\uacf5\uc8fc; 27 June 1603 \u2013 8 September 1685), eleventh daughter\nThirteenth daughter (1604\u20131604)\nYi Ui, Grand Prince Yeongchang (\uc774\uc758 \uc601\ucc3d\ub300\uad70; 12 April 1606 \u2013 19 March 1614), thirteenth son\nRoyal Noble Consort Gong of the Gimhae Kim clan (\uacf5\ube48 \uae40\uc528; 16 November 1553 \u2013 13 June 1577)\nYi Jin, Prince Imhae (\uc774\uc9c4 \uc784\ud574\uad70; 20 September 1572 \u2013 3 June 1609), first son\nCrown Prince Yi Hon (\uc655\uc138\uc790 \uc774\ud63c; 4 June 1575 \u2013 7 August 1641), second son\nRoyal Noble Consort In of the Suwon Kim clan (\uc778\ube48 \uae40\uc528; 1555\u20131613)\nYi Seong, Prince Uian (\uc774\uc131 \uc758\uc548\uad70; 1577 \u2013 24 February 1588), third son\nYi Ho, Prince Shinseong (\uc774\ud6c4 \uc2e0\uc131\uad70; 6 January 1579 \u2013 8 December 1592), fourth son\nYi Bu, Prince Jeongwon (\uc774\ubd80 \uc815\uc6d0\uad70; 2 August 1580 \u2013 29 December 1619), fifth son\nPrincess Jeongsin (\uc815\uc2e0\uc639\uc8fc; 1583\u20131653), first daughter\nPrincess Jeongsuk (\uc815\uc219\uc639\uc8fc; 1587 \u2013 6 November 1627), second daughter\nYi Gwang, Prince Uichang (\uc774\uad11 \uc758\ucc3d\uad70; 1589\u20131645), eighth son\nPrincess Jeongan (\uc815\uc548\uc639\uc8fc; 1590\u20131660), fifth daughter\nPrincess Jeonghwi (\uc815\ud718\uc639\uc8fc; 1593 \u2013 15 July 1653), sixth daughter\nRoyal Noble Consort Sun of the Gimhae Kim clan (\uc21c\ube48 \uae40\uc528; 1565 \u2013 1647)\nYi Bu, Prince Sunhwa (\uc774\ubd80 \uc21c\ud654\uad70; 10 October 1580 \u2013 18 March 1607), sixth son\nRoyal Noble Consort Jeong of the Yeoheung Min clan (\uc815\ube48 \ubbfc\uc528; 1567\u20131626)\nYi Gong, Prince Inseong (\uc774\uacf5 \uc778\uc131\uad70; 29 October 1588 \u2013 20 May 1628), seventh son\nPrincess Jeongin  (\uc815\uc778\uc639\uc8fc; 1590 \u2013 10 January 1656), fourth daughter\nPrincess Jeongseon (\uc815\uc120\uc639\uc8fc; 1 April 1594 \u2013 1 August 1674), seventh daughter\nPrincess Jeonggeun (\uc815\uadfc\uc639\uc8fc; 1598 \u2013 11 July 1613), tenth daughter\nYi Yeong, Prince Inheung (\uc774\uc601 \uc778\ud765\uad70; 1604\u20131651), twelfth son\nRoyal Noble Consort Jeong of the Namyang Hong clan (\uc815\ube48 \ud64d\uc528; 1563\u20131638)\nPrincess Jeongjeong (\uc815\uc815\uc639\uc8fc; 1595\u20131666), eighth daughter\nYi Ju, Prince Gyeongchang (\uc774\uc8fc \uacbd\ucc3d\uad70; 23 September 1596 \u2013 16 January 1654), ninth son\nRoyal Noble Consort On of the Cheongju Han clan (\uc628\ube48 \ud55c\uc528; 2 November 1581 \u2013 10 December 1664)\nYi Je, Prince Heungan (\uc774\uc81c \ud765\uc548\uad70; 1598\u20131624), tenth son\nYi Reuk, Prince Gyeongpyeong (\uc774\ub975 \uacbd\ud3c9\uad70; June 1600 \u2013 28 November 1673), eleventh son\nPrincess Jeonghwa (\uc815\ud654\uc639\uc8fc; 1604\u20131667), fourteenth daughter\nYi Gye, Prince Yeongseon (\uc774\uacc4 \uc601\uc120\uad70; 21 January 1607 \u2013 24 October 1649), fourteenth son\nRoyal Consort Gwi-in of the Yeonil Jeong clan (\uadc0\uc778 \uc815\uc528; 1557\u20131579)\nRoyal Consort Suk-ui of the Dongnae Jeong clan (\uc219\uc758 \uc815\uc528; 1564\u20131580)\nRoyal Consort Suk-ui of the Kim clan (\uc219\uc758 \uae40\uc528)\nRoyal Consort Suk-ui of the Han clan (\uc219\uc758 \ud55c\uc528)\nDeposed Royal Consort So-won of the Yun clan (\ud3d0 \uc18c\uc6d0 \uc724\uc528; ?
