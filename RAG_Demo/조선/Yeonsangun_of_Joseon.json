Often considered the worst tyrant in Joseon's history and perhaps all Korean history, he is notorious for launching two bloody purges, seizing hundreds of women from all over the peninsula to serve as palace entertainers, and appropriating Sungkyunkwan as a personal pleasure ground. Yeonsangun's despotic rule provided a stark contrast to the liberal era of his father, and as a much-despised overthrown monarch, he did not receive a temple name.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Execution of his mother ===\nLady Yun, later known as the Deposed Queen Yun, served Yeonsangun's father, King Seongjong, as a concubine until the death of Queen Gonghye, Seongjong's first wife. With no heir, the king was urged by counselors to take a second wife to secure the royal succession. Lady Yun was chosen for her beauty and was formally married in 1476. Several months later, she gave birth to Yi Yung.\nThe new queen proved to be temperamental and highly jealous of the other concubines, even going as far as poisoning one of them in 1477. One night in 1479, she physically struck her husband and left scratch marks. Despite his efforts to conceal the injury, Seongjong's mother, Royal Queen Dowager Insu, discovered the truth and ordered Lady Yun into exile. After several attempts to restore the deposed queen to her former position, government officials petitioned that she be executed. Queen Yun died in 1482, after being ordered to commit suicide by drinking poison.\n\n\n=== Literati purges ===\n\nThe crown prince grew up believing that he was the son of Queen Jeonghyeon, his father's third wife. He succeeded to the throne in 1495 and during his early reign, he was a wise and able administrator who strengthened the national defense and aided the poor. However, he also showed signs of a violent side when he killed Jo Sa-seo, one of his tutors, soon after becoming king.\nYeonsangun eventually learned the truth about his biological mother and attempted to posthumously restore her titles and position. However, government officials belonging to the Sarim faction opposed his efforts on account of serving Seongjong's will, and greatly displeased, Yeonsangun started looking for ways to eliminate them.\nIn 1498, Kim Il-son, a disciple of Kim Chong-jik, included a paragraph in the royal records that was critical of King Sejo's coup d'\u00e9tat (1455). Kim Il-son and other followers of Kim Chong-jik were accused of treason by a rival faction, giving the king cause enough to order the execution of many Sarim officials and the mutilation of Kim Chong-jik's remains. This came to be known as the First Literati Purge (Muo Sahwa; \ubb34\uc624\uc0ac\ud654, \u620a\u5348\u58eb\u798d).\nIn 1504, Im Sa-hong revealed to Yeonsangun the details of his mother's death and showed him a blood-stained piece of clothing that was obtained from Lady Yun's mother, the blood allegedly vomited by her after taking poison.\nSubsequently, Yeonsangun beat to death two of his father's concubines, Lady Jeong and Lady Eom, for their part in his mother's death. His grandmother, Grand Royal Queen Dowager Insu, also passed away soon after he pushed her during an altercation. He sentenced to death many government officials who had supported the execution of his mother, now posthumously honored as \"Queen Jeheon\" (\uc81c\ud5cc\uc655\ud6c4; \u9f4a\u737b\u738b\u540e), and ordered the grave of Han Myeong-hoe to be opened and the head to be cut off the corpse.\n\nYeonsangun went as far as punishing officials who were simply present at the royal court at that time, for the crime of not preventing the actions of those who abused his mother. Meanwhile, Im Sa-hong and his allies were promoted and they received many important offices and other rewards. This came to be known as the Second Literati Purge (Gapja Sahwa; \uac11\uc790\uc0ac\ud654, \u7532\u5b50\u58eb\u798d).\n\n\n=== Suppression of free speech and learning ===\nYeonsangun closed Sungkyunkwan, the royal university, as well as the temple Wongaksa, and converted them into personal pleasure grounds, for which young girls were gathered from the eight provinces. He also demolished a large residential area in the capital and evicted 20,000 residents to build hunting grounds. People were forced into involuntary labor to work on these projects. Many commoners mocked and insulted him with posters written in hangul, and in retaliation, Yeonsangun banned the use of the script. Furthermore, Yeonsangun was the only monarch of the Joseon dynasty who tried to dismantle Buddhism in Joseon, he attempted to abolish the system of head monasteries and examinations during his reign.\nWhen court officials protested against his actions, he abolished the Office of Censors (whose function was to criticize any inappropriate actions or policies of the king) and the Office of Special Advisors (a library and research institute that advised the king with Confucian teachings). He ordered his ministers to wear a sign that read: \"A mouth is a door that brings in disaster; a tongue is a sword that cuts off a head. A body will be in peace as long as its mouth is closed and its tongue is deep within\" (\u53e3\u662f\u798d\u4e4b\u9580 \u820c\u662f\u65ac\u8eab\u5200 \u9589\u53e3\u6df1\u85cf\u820c \u5b89\u8eab\u8655\u8655\u7262).\nChief Eunuch Kim Cheo-sun, who had served three kings, tried to convince him to change his ways, but Yeonsangun killed him by shooting arrows and personally cutting off his limbs. In addition, he also punished the eunuch's relatives down to the 7th degree, and when he asked the royal secretaries whether such punishment was appropriate, they did not dare to say otherwise.\n\n\n=== Hangul ban ===\nOn July 19, 1504, the 10th year of his reign, three Hangul 'tuseo's (\ud22c\uc11c; \u6295\u66f8), with the contents mocking and insulting him for his tyranny was discovered. The tuseos criticized him of his violence to his ministers, and his lust for women, and the author was unidentifiable. Enraged, Yeonsan ordered a total ban of the learning, teaching, or using of Hangul, and ordered the five Hansung administrative districts to identify and report of the individuals who know to use it, and to punish people who knowingly didn't report of their neighbors; He also ordered for the comparisons of handwriting of people who have been reported. In addition,he hung up high-ranking titles and lots of money as bounty for the author.\nOn July 22, he ordered the beheadings of people who use Hangul, and a hundred beatings (\uace4\uc7a5; \u68cd\u6756) for persons who knowingly did not report others. He ordered his court's ministers to burn all books at their homes with Hangul Gugyeol footnotes, however allowed Hangul books translated from Hanja.\nThere is a misconception that Yeonsan ordered the burnings of all Hangul books, but that is not true. Yeonsan allowed Hangul books translated from Hanja, or Unhaeseo (\uc5b8\ud574\uc11c; \u8afa\u89e3\u66f8); These books were often the works from a former monarch, and it is speculated that even a tyrant like Yeonsan couldn't have purged the achievements of the former monarchs, which were also his ancestors.\nThe rounding up of people who knew Hangul and the investigations continued through early August, but they failed to catch the culprit, and Yeonsan's short lived Hangul ban was over; Later in December Yeonsan himself ordered the translations of calendar-books (\uc5ed\uc11c; \u66c6\u66f8) into Hangul, and in September next year he ordered for the translations and recitals of a mourning script (\uc81c\ubb38; \u796d\u6587) regarding a dead court woman.\n\n\n=== Dethronement ===\n\nIn 1506, the 12th year of Yeonsangun's reign, a group of officials \u2014 notably Pak W\u014fnjong, S\u014fng H\u016diann, Yu Sunj\u014fng, and Hong Gyeong-ju \u2014 plotted against the despotic ruler. They launched their coup in September 1506, deposing the king and replacing him with his younger half-brother, Grand Prince Jinseong. The king was demoted to \"Prince Yeonsan\" (Yeonsangun; \u71d5\u5c71\u541b, \uc5f0\uc0b0\uad70) and sent into exile on Ganghwa Island, where he died after two months.  His concubine, Jang Nok-su, who had encouraged and supported his misrule, was beheaded. In addition, despite the new king's reluctance, Yeonsangun's four young sons were also forced to commit suicide by poison only a few weeks later.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\n\n=== Parents ===\nFather: King Seongjong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120 \uc131\uc885; 19 August 1457 \u2013 20 January 1495)\nGrandfather: King Deokjong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120 \ub355\uc885; 3 October 1438 \u2013 2 September 1457)\nGrandmother: Queen Sohye of the Cheongju Han clan (\uc18c\ud61c\uc655\ud6c4 \ud55c\uc528; 7 October 1437 \u2013 11 May 1504)\nBiological mother: Deposed Queen Yun of the Haman Yun clan (\ud3d0\ube44 \uc724\uc528; 15 July 1455 \u2013 29 August 1482)\nGrandfather: Yun Gi-gyeon (\uc724\uae30\uacac; 1416\u2013?)\nGrandmother: Lady Shin of the Goryeong Shin clan (\uace0\ub839 \uc2e0\uc528; 1426\u2013?)\nAdoptive mother: Queen Jeonghyeon of the Papyeong Yun clan (\uc815\ud604\uc655\ud6c4 \uc724\uc528; 21 July 1462 \u2013 13 September 1530)\n\n\n=== Consorts and issue ===\nDeposed Queen Shin of the Geochang Shin clan (\ud3d0\ube44 \uc2e0\uc528; 15 December 1476 \u2013 16 May 1537)\nYi Su-eok, Deposed Princess Hwisin (\ud3d0\ud718\uc2e0\uacf5\uc8fc \uc774\uc218\uc5b5; 2 September 1491 \u2013 ?), first daughter\nFirst son (1494\u20131494)\nSecond daughter\nThird daughter (1495-?)\nDeposed Crown Prince Yi Hwang (\ud3d0\uc138\uc790 \uc774\ud669; 10 January 1498 \u2013 24 September 1506), second son\nYi Seong, Deposed Grand Prince Changnyeong (\ud3d0\ucc3d\ub155\ub300\uad70 \uc774\uc131; 18 June 1500 \u2013 24 September 1506), fourth son\nYi Yeong-su (\uc774\uc601\uc218; 1501\u20131503), fifth son\nYi In-su (\uc774\uc778\uc218; 1501 \u2013 1503), sixth son\nSeventh son (1502 \u2013 ?)\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Yangseong Yi clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc758 \uc774\uc528; 1480 \u2013 ?)\nYi In, Deposed Prince Yangpyeong (\ud3d0\uc591\ud3c9\uad70 \uc774\uc778; 1498 \u2013 24 September 1506), third son\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Haepyeong Yun clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc758 \uc724\uc528; 1482\u20131568)\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Hyeonpung Gwak clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc758 \uacfd\uc528; 1483\u2013?)\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Gwon clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc758 \uad8c\uc528; 1477\u2013?)\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Yeoheung Min clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc758 \ubbfc\uc528; 1483\u20131519)\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-yong of the Heungdeok Jang clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc6a9 \uc7a5\uc528; 1484\u20131506)\nYi Yeong-su (\uc774\uc601\uc218; 1502\u20131517), sixth daughter\nYi Ham-geum (\uc774\ud568\uae08), eighth daughter\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-yong of the Damyang Jeon clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc6a9 \uc804\uc528; 1480\u20131506)\nNinth daughter\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-yong of the Jo clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc6a9 \uc870\uc528; 1482 \u2013 ?)\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-won of the Choe clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc6d0 \ucd5c\uc528; 1485 \u2013 ?)\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-won of the Jang clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc6d0 \uc7a5\uc528)\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-won of the Yi clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc6d0 \uc774\uc528)\nDeposed Royal Consort Suk-won of the Kim clan (\ud3d0\uc219\uc6d0 \uae40\uc528; 1481\u20131506)\nPalace Maid Choe (\ub098\uc778 \ucd5c\uc528; ?
