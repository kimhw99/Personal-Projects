He was the second son of King Jeongjo by his concubine, Royal Noble Consort Su of the Bannam Park clan. His reign saw oppression against Catholics and his failed attempts at reforms which resulted in riots, notably by Hong Gyeong-nae in 1811.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born with the title of His Royal Highness Prince Yi Gong on 29 July 1790 (18 June 1790 in lunar calendar). Upon the death of his father, King Jeongjo, Yi Gong ascended to the throne at age 10 on 4 July 1800, lunar calendar.\nIn 1802, aged 13, King Sunjo married Lady Kim, known posthumously as Queen Sunwon, daughter of Kim Jo-sun, who was a leader of the Andong Kim clan.\nSince he ascended the throne at a young age, Queen Dowager Jeongsun, the second queen of King Yeongjo, ruled as queen regent, which allowed her to wield power over state affairs. Queen Jeongsun's influence was to such extent that during Sunjo's reign, the status of Lady Hyegy\u014fng, the mother of Jeongjo and the grandmother of Sunjo, became a point of contention. During Jeonjo's reign, Lady Hyegy\u014fng was treated with respect and as the mother of King Jeongjo despite the fact that Lady Hyegy\u014fng was married to Crown Prince Sado who had been forced to commit suicide during the reign of Yeongjo, which had greatly affected Hyegyeong's status due to the controversy surrounding Sado's suicide. Following Sunjo's ascension, her status was lowered and despite Sunjo's efforts to reverse this later in his reign, they were unsuccessful.\nDespite King Sunjo's efforts to reform politics, the fundamental principles of government deteriorated. The state examination became disordered and corruption in the government personnel administration prevailed. This resulted in disorder in society and various riots broke out among the people, including the revolt by Hong Gyeong-nae in 1811\u20131812. The Ogajaktongbeop (\u4e94\u5bb6\u4f5c\u7d71\u6cd5), a census registration system to group five houses as one unit, was carried out in this period, and oppression against Catholicism began in earnest.\n\nIn 1811 the last diplomatic envoys were sent by Korea to Japan. Based on records of that trip, a reconstruction of the diplomatic vessel has been made for the National Maritime Museum of Korea.\nKing Sunjo died after reigning for 35 years in 1834 at the age of 44. He was first buried next to Jangneung, Paju, the tomb of King Injo and Queen Inryeol but later moved to Illeung, Seoul as the Feng Shui at the old site was deemed to be unfavourable.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nFather: King Jeongjo of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \uc815\uc870; 28 October 1752 \u2013 18 August 1800)\nGrandfather: King Jangjo of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \uc7a5\uc870; 13 February 1735 \u2013 12 July 1762)\nGrandmother: Queen Heongyeong of the Pungsan Hong clan (\ud5cc\uacbd\uc655\ud6c4 \ud64d\uc528; 6 August 1735 \u2013 13 January 1816)\nMother: Royal Noble Consort Su of the Bannam Park clan (\uc218\ube48 \ubc15\uc528; 8 May 1770 \u2013 26 December 1822)\nGrandfather: Park Jun-won (\ubc15\uc900\uc6d0; 1739\u20131807)\nGrandmother: Lady Won of the Wonju Won clan (\uc6d0\uc8fc \uc6d0\uc528; 1740\u20131783)\nConsort(s) and their respective issue\n\nQueen Sunwon of the Andong Kim clan (\uc21c\uc6d0 \uc655\ud6c4 \uc548\ub3d9 \uae40\uc528; 8 August 1789 \u2013 21 September 1857)\nYi Yeong, Crown Prince Hyomyeong (\uc774\uc601 \ud6a8\uba85\uc138\uc790; 18 September 1809 \u2013 25 June 1830), first son\nPrincess Myeongon (\uba85\uc628\uacf5\uc8fc; 1810\u20131832), first daughter\nPrincess Bokon (\ubcf5\uc628\uacf5\uc8fc; 1818\u20131832), third daughter\nSecond son (1820\u20131820)\nPrincess Deokon (\ub355\uc628\uacf5\uc8fc; 1822\u20131844), fourth daughter\nYi Byeon, King Cheoljong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \ucca0\uc885 \uc774\ubcc0; 25 July 1831 \u2013 16 January 1864), adopted son\nRoyal Consort Suk-ui of the Miryang Park clan (\uc219\uc758 \ubc15\uc528; 1791 \u2013 1854)\nPrincess Yeongon (\uc601\uc628\uc639\uc8fc; 1817\u20131829), second daughter\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nPortrayed by Kim Seung-soo in the 2016 KBS2 TV series Love in the Moonlight.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Korea\nHong Gyeong-nae\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}}}}
