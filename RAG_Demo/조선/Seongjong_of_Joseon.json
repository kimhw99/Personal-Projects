Before succeeding his uncle, King Yejong, he was known as Grand Prince Jalsan (\uc798\uc0b0\ub300\uad70; \u4e7d\u5c71\u5927\u541b).\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nYi Hyeol was born as the second son of Crown Prince Yi Jang and Crown Princess Su of the Cheongju Han clan. His father however died few months after his birth. In 1461, he was named Prince Jasan (\uc790\uc0b0\uad70) which was changed to Prince Jalsan (\uc798\uc0b0\uad70) in 1468.\nIn 1467, he married Han Song-yi, the youngest daughter of Han Myeong-hoe. One of Lady Han's older sisters was the late Crown Princess Jangsun, first wife of King Yejong.\nDespite having an older brother and his uncle leaving behind a biological son, Jalsan was chosen as successor and was made the adopted son of King Yejong and his second wife, Queen Han (posthumously known as Queen Ansun).\nAfter he ascended to the throne, his biological father was honored with the temple name \"Deokjong\" (\ub355\uc885; \u5fb7\u5b97), while his mother became queen and was given the honorary name \"Insu\" (\uc778\uc218; \u4ec1\u7cb9).\n\n\n=== Reign ===\nSince Seongjong was only 12 when he was crowned, his grandmother Grand Royal Queen Dowager Jaseong, ruled the nation along with his biological mother Queen Insu, and his aunt (and adoptive mother) Queen Dowager Inhye. In 1476, at the age of 19, he began to govern the country in his own name.\nAfter the death of his first wife in 1474, Seongjong decided to promote one of his concubines, Lady Yun, to the status of primary wife and queen. Lady Yun was later executed due to her attempts to poison other concubines and harm the King, and her execution would become a major reason behind the tyranny of Seongjong's successor, Yeonsangun of Joseon.\nHis reign was marked by the prosperity and growth of the economy, based on the laws laid down by Taejong, Sejong, and Sejo. He himself was a gifted ruler. In 1474, the Grand Code for State Administration, started by his grandfather, was completed and put into effect. Seongjong also ordered revisions and improvements to the code.\nHe greatly expanded the Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan; \ud64d\ubb38\uad00, \u5f18\u6587\u9928), an advisory council to the king, which also served as royal library and research institute; he strengthened the Three Offices (Samsa; \uc0bc\uc0ac, \u4e09\u53f8) \u2013 Office of the Inspector General (Saheonbu), Office of Censors (Saganwon) and Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan)\u2013 as a check and balance on the royal court. For the first time since Sejong the Great, Confucian scholars whose political views clashed with those of the conservative officials (members of the nobility who had helped Taejong and Sejo in their rise to power), were brought to court. By appointing able administrators regardless of their political views, Seongjong made his rule more effective and his policies resulted in many positive innovations, increasing his number of supporters. During Seongjong's reign, he also prohibited the construction of new monasteries and the ordination of new monks.\n\nThe king himself was an artist and intellectual, and liked to argue about the finer points of politics with the more liberal scholars. He encouraged the publication of numerous books about geography and social etiquette, as well as areas of knowledge that benefited the common people.\nIt was under Seongjong's reign that the \"Widow Remarriage Ban\" (1477) was enacted, which strengthened pre-existing social stigma against women who remarried by barring their sons from public office. In 1489, Yi Gu-ji, a woman from the royal clan, committed suicide at his order and was erased from family records, when it was discovered that she had cohabited with her slave after being widowed.\nIn 1491, Seongjong started a military campaign against the Jurchens on the northern border, like many of his predecessors. Led by General Heo Jong (\ud5c8\uc885; \u8a31\u742e), the campaign was successful, and the defeated Jurchens commanded by Udige (\u5140\u72c4\u54c8) retreated to the north of Amrok River.\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\nHe died in January 1495 and is buried in the south of Seoul. The tomb is known as Seonneung (\uc120\ub989) and 35 years later, his third wife, Queen Jeonghyeon, was also interred here. Seongjong was succeeded by his son, Crown Prince Yi Yung.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\n\n=== Parents ===\nBiological father: King Deokjong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120 \ub355\uc885; 1438 \u2013 2 September 1457)\nAdoptive father: King Yejong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120 \uc608\uc885; 12 February 1450 \u2013 31 December 1469)\nBiological mother: Queen Sohye of the Cheongju Han clan (\uc18c\ud61c\uc655\ud6c4 \ud55c\uc528; 7 October 1437 \u2013 11 May 1504)\nAdoptive mother: Queen Ansun of the Cheongju Han clan (\uc548\uc21c\uc655\ud6c4 \ud55c\uc528; 18 April 1445 \u2013 3 February 1499)\n\n\n=== Consorts and issue ===\nQueen Gonghye of the Cheongju Han clan (\uacf5\ud61c\uc655\ud6c4 \ud55c\uc528; 8 November 1456 \u2013 30 April 1474)\nDeposed Queen Yun of the Haman Yun clan (\ud3d0\ube44 \uc724\uc528; 15 July 1455 \u2013 29 August 1482)\nYi Hyo-shin (\uc774\ud6a8\uc2e0; 1474\u20131475), first son\nCrown Prince Yi Yung (\uc655\uc138\uc790 \uc774\uc735; 2 December 1476 \u2013 30 November 1506), second son\nThird son (1478\u20131479)\nQueen Jeonghyeon of the Papyeong Yun clan (\uc815\ud604\uc655\ud6c4 \uc724\uc528; 21 July 1462 \u2013 13 September 1530)\nPrincess Sunsuk (\uc21c\uc219\uacf5\uc8fc; 1478 \u2013 20 August 1488), first daughter\nPrincess Shinsuk (\uc2e0\uc219\uacf5\uc8fc; 1481 \u2013 14 July 1486), sixth daughter\nEighth daughter (1485\u20131486)\nYi Yeok, Grand Prince Jinseong (\uc9c4\uc131\ub300\uad70 \uc774\uc5ed; 25 April 1488 \u2013 9 December 1544), eleventh son\nYi Yeon, Prince Euncheon (\uc774\uc5f0 \uc740\ucc9c\uad70; 1490\u20131524), seventeenth son\nFourteenth daughter (1490\u20131490)\nRoyal Noble Consort Myeong of the Andong Kim clan (\uba85\ube48 \uae40\uc528; 1470 \u2013 ?)\nPrincess Hwisuk (\ud718\uc219\uc639\uc8fc; 1481 \u2013 ?), fourth daughter\nYi Hap-hwan, Princess Gyeongsuk (\uacbd\uc219\uc639\uc8fc \uc774\ud569\ud658; 19 September 1483 \u2013 ?), seventh daughter\nYi Jong, Prince Musan (\ubb34\uc0b0\uad70 \uc774\uc885; 1490 \u2013 20 August 1525), sixteenth son\nPrincess Hwijeong (\ud718\uc815\uc639\uc8fc; 1489 \u2013 ?), twelfth daughter\nRoyal Consort Gwi-in of the Yeongwol Eom clan (\uadc0\uc778 \uc5c4\uc528; ?
