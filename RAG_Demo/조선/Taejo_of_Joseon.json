After overthrowing the Goryeo dynasty, he ascended to the throne in 1392 and abdicated six years later during a strife between his sons. He was honored as Emperor Go (\uace0\ud669\uc81c; \u9ad8\u7687\u5e1d) following the establishment of the Korean Empire.\nTaejo emphasized continuity over change. No new institutions were created, and no massive purges occurred during his reign. His new dynasty was largely dominated by the same ruling families and officials that had served the previous regime. He re-established amicable ties with Japan and improved relations with Ming China.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nThe future King Taejo was born in Ssangseong Prefecture on the frontiers of the Yuan dynasty. Taejo's father was Yi Cha-ch'un, an official of Korean ethnicity serving the Mongol-led Yuan. His mother, Lady Ch'oe, came from a family originally from Deungju (present-day Anby\u014fn County, North Korea). In 1356, the Yi family defected to Goryeo, helping Goryeo seize control of Ssangseong Prefecture from its governor, Cho So-saeng.\n\n\n=== Historical context ===\nBy the late 14th century, the 400-year-old Goryeo dynasty established by Wang K\u014fn in 918 was tottering, its foundations collapsing from years of war and de facto occupation by the disintegrating Mongol Empire. The legitimacy of the royal family itself was also becoming an increasingly disputed issue within the court. The ruling house not only failed to govern the kingdom effectively but was also affected by rivalry among its various branches and by generations of forced intermarriage with members of the Yuan imperial family. King U's biological mother being a known slave led to rumors contesting his descent from King Gongmin.\nInfluential aristocrats, generals, and ministers struggled for royal favor and vied for domination of the court, resulting in deep divisions between various factions. With the ever-increasing number of raids against Goryeo conducted by Japanese pirates and the Red Turbans, those who came to dominate the royal court were the reform-minded Sinjin faction of the scholar-officials and the opposing Gwonmun faction of the old aristocratic families as well as generals who could actually fight off the foreign threats\u2014namely Yi S\u014fng-gye and his rival Ch'oe Y\u014fng. As the Ming dynasty started to emerge, the Yuan forces became more vulnerable, and Goryeo regained its full independence by the mid-1350s although Yuan remnants effectively occupied northeastern territories with large garrisons of troops.\n\n\n=== Military career ===\nYi S\u014fng-gye started his career as a military officer in 1360 and would eventually rise up the ranks. In October 1361, he killed Pak \u016ci who rebelled against the government. In the same year when the Red Turbans had invaded and seized Gaegyeong (present-day Kaes\u014fng), he helped recapture the capital city with 3,000 men. In 1362, General Naghachu invaded Goryeo and Yi S\u014fng-gye defeated him after being appointed as commander.\nGeneral Yi had gained prestige during the late 1370s and early 1380s by pushing Mongol remnants off the peninsula and also by repelling the well-organized Japanese pirates in a series of successful engagements. In the wake of the rise of the Ming dynasty under Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), the royal court in Goryeo split into two competing factions: the camp led by General Yi (supporting the Ming) and the one led by General Choe (supporting the Yuan).\nWhen a Ming messenger came to Goryeo in 1388 to demand the return of a significant portion of Goryeo's northern territory, Ch'oe Y\u014fng seized the opportunity and played upon the prevailing anti-Ming atmosphere to argue for the invasion of the Liaodong Peninsula. Goryeo claimed to be the successor of the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo; as such, reclaiming Manchuria as part of Korean territory was a tenet of its foreign policy throughout its history.\nA staunchly opposed Yi S\u014fng-gye was chosen to lead the invasion; however, at Wihwa Island on the Amnok River, he made a momentous decision known as the Wihwado Retreat (\uc704\ud654\ub3c4 \ud68c\uad70; \u5a01\u5316\u5cf6 \u56de\u8ecd; lit. 'Turning back the army from Wihwa Island') which would alter the course of Korean history. Aware of the support he enjoyed from both high-ranking officials and the general populace, he decided to revolt and return to Gaegyeong to secure control of the government.\n\n\n=== Revolt ===\nGeneral Yi led his army from the Amnok River straight into the capital, defeated forces loyal to the royal family (led by General Ch'oe whom he proceeded to eliminate), and forcibly dethroned King U in a de facto coup d'\u00e9tat but did not ascend to the throne himself. Instead, he placed on the throne King U's eight-year-old son, Wang Ch'ang, and following a failed attempt to restore the former king to the throne, had both U and his son put to death. Yi S\u014fng-gye, now the undisputed power behind the throne, soon forcibly had a distant royal relative named Wang Yo (posthumously King Gongyang) crowned as the new ruler, even among opposition from Goryeo loyalists. After indirectly enforcing his grasp on the royal court through the puppet king, he proceeded to ally himself with Sinjin scholar-officials such as Ch\u014fng To-j\u014fn and Cho Chun.\nOne of the most widely known events that occurred during this period was in 1392 when one of Yi S\u014fng-gye's sons, Yi Pang-w\u014fn, organized a banquet for the renowned scholar and statesman Ch\u014fng Mong-ju who refused to be won over by General Yi despite their assorted correspondence in the form of archaic poems and continued to be a faithful advocate for the old regime. Ch\u014fng Mong-ju was revered throughout Goryeo, even by Yi Pang-w\u014fn himself, but in the eyes of the supporters of the new dynasty, he was seen as an obstacle which had to be removed. After the banquet, he was killed by five men on the Seonjuk Bridge.\n\n\n=== Reign ===\nIn 1392, Yi S\u014fng-gye forced King Gongyang to abdicate, exiled him to Wonju (where he and his family were secretly executed), and enthroned himself as the new king, thus ending Goryeo's 475 years of rule. In 1393, he changed his dynasty's name to Joseon.\nAmong his early achievements was the improvement of relations with the Ming; this had its origin in Taejo's refusal to attack their neighbor. Shortly after his accession, he sent envoys to inform the court at Nanjing that a dynastic change had taken place. Envoys were also dispatched to Japan, seeking the re-establishment of amicable connections. The mission was successful, and Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was reported to have been favorably impressed by this embassy. Envoys from the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom were received in 1392, 1394 and 1397, as well as from Siam in 1393.\nIn 1394, the new capital was established at Hanseong (present-day Seoul).\nWhen the new dynasty was officially promulgated, the issue of which son would be the heir to the throne was brought up. Although Yi Pang-w\u014fn, Taejo's fifth son by his first wife Queen Sinui, had contributed the most to his father's rise to power, he harbored a profound hatred against two of Taejo's key allies, Ch\u014fng To-j\u014fn and Nam \u016cn.\nBoth sides were fully aware of the mutual animosity and felt constantly threatened. When it became clear that Yi Pang-w\u014fn was the most worthy successor, Ch\u014fng To-j\u014fn used his influence to convince the king that the wisest choice would be the son that he loved most, not the son that he felt was best for the kingdom.\nIn 1392, the eighth son of King Taejo and his second son by Queen Sindeok, Yi Pang-s\u014fk, was appointed as crown prince. After the sudden death of the queen in 1396 and while Taejo was still in mourning for his wife, Ch\u014fng To-j\u014fn began conspiring to preemptively kill Yi Pang-w\u014fn and his brothers to secure his position in the royal court.\nUpon hearing of this plan in 1398, Yi Pang-w\u014fn immediately revolted and raided the palace, killing Ch\u014fng To-j\u014fn, his followers, and the two sons of the late Queen Sindeok. This incident became known as the First Strife of Princes (\uc81c1\ucc28 \uc655\uc790\uc758 \ub09c). Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the throne and psychologically exhausted by the death of his second wife, Taejo immediately named his second son, Yi Pang-gwa (posthumously King Jeongjong), as the new successor and abdicated.\nThereafter, Taejo retired to the Hamhung Royal Villa and maintained distance with his fifth son for the rest of his life. Allegedly, Yi Pang-w\u014fn sent emissaries numerous times and each time the former king executed them to express his firm decision not to meet his son again. This historical anecdote gave birth to the term Hamhung Chasa (\ud568\ud765\ucc28\uc0ac; \u54b8\u8208\u5dee\u4f7f) which means a person who never comes back despite several nudges. However, recent studies have found that Taejo did not actually execute any of the emissaries; these people died during revolts which coincidentally occurred in the region.\nIn 1400, King Jeongjong named Yi Pang-w\u014fn as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. That same year, Yi Pang-w\u014fn assumed the throne of Joseon; he is posthumously known as King Taejong.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nKing Taejo died ten years after his abdication on 27 June 1408 in Changdeokgung. He was buried at Geonwolleung (\uac74\uc6d0\ub989) in the Donggureung Cluster (present-day Guri, South Korea). The tomb of his umbilical cord is located in Geumsan County, South Korea.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nAlthough Taejo overthrew Goryeo and expelled officials who remained loyal to the previous dynasty, many regard him as a revolutionary and a decisive ruler who eliminated an inept, obsolete and crippled governing system to save the nation from foreign forces and conflicts.\nThe resulting safeguarding of domestic security led the Koreans to rebuild and further discover their culture. In the midst of the rival Yuan and Ming dynasties, Joseon encouraged the development of national identity which was once threatened by the Mongols. However, some scholars, particularly in North Korea, view Taejo as a mere traitor to the old regime and bourgeois apostate while paralleling him to General Ch'oe Y\u014fng, a military elite who conservatively served Goryeo to death.\nHis diplomatic successes in securing Korea in the early modern period are notable.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\n\n=== Parents ===\nFather: Yi Cha-ch'un, King Hwanjo of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \ud658\uc870 \uc774\uc790\ucd98; 1315 \u2013 3 May 1360)\nGrandfather: Yi Ch'un, King Dojo of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \ub3c4\uc870 \uc774\ucd98; ? \u2013 25 August 1342)\nGrandmother: Queen Gyeongsun of the Munju Park clan (\uacbd\uc21c\uc655\ud6c4 \ubc15\uc528)\nMother: Queen Uihye of the Yeongheung Choe clan (\uc758\ud61c\uc655\ud6c4 \ucd5c\uc528)\nGrandfather: Choe Han-gi, Internal Prince Yeongheung (\uc601\ud765\ubd80\uc6d0\uad70 \ucd5c\ud55c\uae30)\nGrandmother: Lady Yi, Grand Madame of Joseon State (\uc870\uc120\uad6d\ub300\ubd80\uc778 \uc774\uc528)\n\n\n=== Consorts and issue ===\nQueen Sinui of the Cheongju Han clan (\uc2e0\uc758\uc655\ud6c4 \ud55c\uc528; 6 October 1337 \u2013 25 November 1391)\nYi Pang-u, Grand Prince Jinan (\uc9c4\uc548\ub300\uad70 \uc774\ubc29\uc6b0; 1354 \u2013 15 January 1394), first son\nYi Pang-gwa, Prince Yeongan (\uc601\uc548\uad70 \uc774\ubc29\uacfc; 26 July 1357 \u2013 15 October 1419), second son\nYi Pang-ui, Grand Prince Ikan (\uc775\uc548\ub300\uad70 \uc774\ubc29\uc758; 1360 \u2013 29 October 1404), third son\nPrincess Gyeongsin (\uacbd\uc2e0\uacf5\uc8fc; 1362 \u2013 29 April 1426), first daughter\nYi Pang-gan, Grand Prince Hoean (\ud68c\uc548\ub300\uad70 \uc774\ubc29\uac04; 1364 \u2013 10 April 1421), fourth son\nYi Pang-w\u014fn, Prince Jeongan (\uc815\uc548\uad70 \uc774\ubc29\uc6d0; 13 June 1367 \u2013 30 May 1422), fifth son\nYi Pang-y\u014fn, Grand Prince Deokan (\ub355\uc548\ub300\uad70 \uc774\ubc29\uc5f0; 1370 \u2013 1385), sixth son\nPrincess Gyeongseon (\uacbd\uc120\uacf5\uc8fc; 1372 \u2013 ?), second daughter\nQueen Sindeok of the Goksan Kang clan (\uc2e0\ub355\uc655\ud6c4 \uac15\uc528; 12 July 1356 \u2013 15 September 1396)\nPrincess Gyeongsun (\uacbd\uc21c\uacf5\uc8fc; 1375 \u2013 8 September 1407), third daughter\nYi Pang-bon, Grand Prince Muan (\ubb34\uc548\ub300\uad70 \uc774\ubc29\ubc88; 1381 \u2013 6 October 1398), seventh son\nYi Pang-sok, Grand Prince Uian (\uc758\uc548\ub300\uad70 \uc774\ubc29\uc11d; 1382 \u2013 6 October 1398), eighth son\nConsort Seong of the Wonju Won clan (\uc131\ube44 \uc6d0\uc528; 1378 \u2013 12 January 1450)\nRoyal Princess Jeonggyeong of the Goheung Yu clan (\uc815\uacbd\uad81\uc8fc \uc720\uc528; 1350 \u2013 ?)\nPrincess Hwaui of the Kim clan (\ud654\uc758\uc639\uc8fc \uae40\uc528; 1339 \u2013 18 January 1429)\nPrincess Sukshin (\uc219\uc2e0\uc639\uc8fc; 1384 \u2013 17 March 1453), fifth daughter\nLady Chandeok of the Ju clan (\ucc2c\ub355 \uc8fc\uc528; 1338 \u2013 1436)\nPrincess Uiryeong (\uc758\ub839\uc639\uc8fc; 1382 \u2013 15 February 1466), fourth daughter\nPalace Lady Kim (\uad81\uc778 \uae40\uc528)\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\nOne of the many issues demonstrating the early strained relationship between Joseon and Ming was the debate of Taejo's genealogy which began as early as 1394 and became a source of diplomatic friction that lasted over 200 years. The Collected Regulations of the Great Ming erroneously recorded 'Yi Tan' (Taejo's personal name) as the son of Yi In-im and that Yi Tan killed the last four kings of Goryeo. This established Ming's opinion of Taejo as an usurper first and foremost from the time of the Hongwu Emperor when he repeatedly refused to acknowledge Taejo as the new sovereign of the Korean Peninsula. The first mention of this error was in 1518 (about 9 years after the publication). Those who saw the publication petitioned the Ming for redress including, among others, left chanseong Yi Kye-maeng and minister of rites Nam Gon, who wrote Jonggye Byeonmu (\uc885\uacc4\ubcc0\ubb34; \u5b97\u7cfb\u8fa8\u8aa3). It took until 1584 (after many Ming envoys had seen the petitions) through chief scholar Hwang Ch\u014fng-uk that the issue was finally addressed. The Wanli Emperor commissioned a second edition in 1576 (covering the years between 1479 and 1584). About a year after its completion, Yu Hong saw the revision and returned to Joseon with the good news.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nPortrayed by Im Dong-jin in the 1983 KBS TV series Foundation of the Kingdom.\nPortrayed by Kim Mu-saeng in the 1983 MBC TV series The King of Chudong Palace and in the 1996 KBS TV series Tears of the Dragon.\nPortrayed by Lee Jin-woo in the 2005\u20132006 MBC TV series Shin Don.\nPortrayed by Oh Jae-moo in the 2012 SBS TV series Faith.\nPortrayed by Ji Jin-hee in the 2012\u20132013 SBS TV series The Great Seer.\nPortrayed by Yoo Dong-geun in the 2014 KBS1 TV series Jeong Do-jeon.\nPortrayed by Lee Dae-yeon in the 2014 film The Pirates.\nPortrayed by Lee Do-kyung in the 2015 JTBC TV series More Than a Maid.\nPortrayed by Son Byong-ho in the 2015 film Empire of Lust.\nPortrayed by Chun Ho-jin in the 2015\u20132016 SBS TV series Six Flying Dragons.\nPortrayed by Kim Ki-hyeon in the 2016 KBS1 TV series Jang Yeong-sil.\nPortrayed by Lim Jong-yun in the 2016 film Seondal: The Man Who Sells the River.\nPortrayed by Kim Yeong-cheol in the 2019 JTBC TV series My Country: The New Age and 2021 KBS1 TV series The King of Tears, Lee Bang-won.\nPortrayed in the mobile/PC game Rise of Kingdoms.\nPortrayed by Lee Sung-min in the 2025 TVING TV series The Queen Who Crowns.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of monarchs of Korea\nHouse of Yi\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Veritable Records ===\n\n\n=== Secondary Sources ==="}}}}
