He was the second son of King Sukjong by his concubine, Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Haeju Choe clan. Before ascending to power, he was known as Prince Yeoning (\uc5f0\uc789\uad70; \u5ef6\u793d\u541b). His life was characterized by political infighting and resentment due to his biological mother's low-born origins.\nIn 1720, a few months after the accession of his elder half-brother, Yi Yun (posthumously King Gyeongjong), as the 20th king, Yeoning became the crown prince. This induced a large controversy between the political factions. Nevertheless, four years later, at the death of Gyeongjong, he ascended to the throne.\nYeongjo is most remembered for his persistent attempts to reform the taxation system, and reconcile the various factions under his Tangpyeong policy (\ud0d5\ud3c9; \u8569\u5e73; lit. 'Magnificent Harmony'). His reign of nearly 52 years was also marked by the highly controversial execution of his only surviving son, Crown Prince Sado, in 1762. However, in spite of this controversy, Yeongjo has earned a positive reputation in Korean history due to his efforts to rule by Confucian ethics.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Succession to the throne ===\nIn 1720, King Sukjong died and Crown Prince Yi Yun, Sukjong's eldest son, ascended to the throne as King Gyeongjong, at the age of 33. Before he died in 1720, Sukjong supposedly told Yi I-myeong to name Prince Yeoning as Gyeongjong's heir, but in the absence of a historiographer or scribe, no record exists. At this time, the Noron faction unsuccessfully tried to pressure the new king to step down in favor of his younger half-brother.\nA few months after Gyeongjong's enthronement, Prince Yeoning was installed as Crown Prince Brother (Wangseje; \uc655\uc138\uc81c, \u738b\u4e16\u5f1f). This aggravated the power struggle and led to the Shinim literati purge of 1721. The Noron sent petitions to the king to no effect while the opposing Soron faction used this to their advantage \u2014 claiming the Noron were trying to usurp power and subsequently getting their rival faction removed from several offices.\nMembers of the Soron faction then came up with a plan to assassinate Yeoning under the pretence of hunting for a white fox said to be haunting the palace, but he sought shelter with his adoptive mother, Queen Dowager Hyesun. Afterwards, he told the king that he would rather go and live as a commoner.\nOn 11 October 1724, King Gyeongjong died. The Soron accused Yeoning of being involved in his brother's death due to the earlier attempt of the Noron faction to have him placed on the throne. Many historians, however, now believe that he could have died from food poisoning caused by contaminated seafood, as he displayed symptoms of the illness. Homer Hulbert described this in his book The History of Korea, where he said, \"But we may well doubt the truth of the rumor, for nothing that is told of that brother indicates that he would commit such an act, and in the second place a man who will eat shrimps in mid-summer, that have been brought 30 miles from the sea without ice might expect to die\". On 16 October 1724, Prince Yeoning ascended the throne as King Yeongjo, the 21st ruler of Joseon.\n\n\n=== Reign ===\nHe was a deeply Confucian monarch, and is said to have had a greater knowledge of the classics than his officials. During the reigns of Yeongjo and his grandson Jeongjo, Confucianization was at its height, as well as the economic recovery from the wars of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. His reign was referred to by American missionary Homer Hulbert as \"one of the most brilliant\" in Joseon's history.\nYeongjo worried deeply for his people. The Annals of the Joseon dynasty record that one day in the 4th year of his reign, King Yeongjo woke up to the sound of early morning rain and said to his courtiers:\n\nOh dear! We have had flood, drought and famines for the past four years because of my lack of virtue, and this year we even went through an unprecedented revolt by a traitor named Yi In-jwa. How can my poor people manage their livelihood under such hardship? There is an old saying, 'War is always followed by a lean year'. Fortunately, however, we haven't had a big famine for the past two years and we pin our hopes on a good harvest this year. Yet I am still nervous because, while the season for harvesting is around the corner, there is no way of knowing if there will be a flood or drought before then. Nobody knows whether a cold rain will pour suddenly and flood the fields awaiting harvest. My lack of goodness might bring upon us such awful things as I fail to win the sympathy of heaven. How can I earn the sympathy of heavens if I do not self-reflect and make efforts myself? I should start with reflecting on myself.\nAs he worried that rain would ruin the harvest and force his unfortunate people to starve, the king ordered his courtiers to reduce the taxes and decrease the number of dishes in his own meals.\nOne early morning 25 years later (1753), the continuous rain reminded Yeongjo of the flood during the fourth year of his reign, when he had eaten less food:\n\nOh! Floods and droughts really happen because I lack virtue. I am much older than that year, but how can my compassion for the people and will to work hard for them be less than back then?\".\nYet again, he ordered a reduction in the number of dishes on his dining table.\nPeople around him described him as an articulate, bright, benevolent and kind monarch. He was penetrating in observation and quick of comprehension.\n\n\n=== Yi In-jwa's Rebellion ===\nAfter the ascension of King Yeongjo to the throne, the position of the Noron faction was restored, and a coalition of the radical faction of the Namin and the excluded Soron faction instigated Yi In-jwa's Rebellion under the pretext of protecting King Gyeongjong. Yeongjo pursued a policy of equal recruitment, believing that factional strife was detrimental to the country's development. In response, the radical faction of the Soron group justified their rebellion by raising suspicions about the circumstances of King Gyeongjong's death and claiming that King Yeongjo was not the legitimate heir of King Sukjong, thereby securing their power. The rebellion began on March 15 when their leader, Yi In-jwa captured Cheongju Castle. The rebel forces, marching toward Hanyang (present-day Seoul), were defeated by the royal army, and the support from the Yeong and Honam regions was also suppressed by local forces, leading to the suppression of the rebellion and execution of Yi In-jwa and his family.\n\n\n=== Policies ===\nRealising the detrimental effect on state administration of the factional strife, Yeongjo attempted to end it as soon as he ascended the throne. He reinstated the short-lived universal military service tax, and then went beyond the palace gates to solicit the opinions of officials, literati (scholars), soldiers and peasants. Yeongjo reduced the military service tax by half and ordered the variance be supplemented by taxes on fisheries, salt, vessels and an additional land tax. He also regularized the financial system of state revenues and expenses by adopting an accounting system. His pragmatic policies allowed payment of taxes on grain from the remote mountainous areas Gyeongsang Province, to the nearby port, with payment in cotton or cash for grain. The circulation of currency was encouraged by increasing coin casting.\nYeongjo's concern for improvement of the peasant's life was manifest in his eagerness to educate the people by distributing important books in the Korean script (Hangul), including the Book of Agriculture.\nThe pluviometer was again manufactured in quantity and distributed to local administration offices and extensive public work projects were undertaken. Yeongjo upgraded the status of posterity of the commoners, opening another possibility for upward social mobility and inevitable change. His policies were intended to reassert the Confucian monarchy and a humanistic rule, but they were unable to stem the tide of social change that resulted.\nMercantile activities rapidly increased in volume. The accumulation of capital through monopoly and wholesales expanded through guild organisations and many merchants were centred in Hanseong. The traditional division of government chartered shop, the license tribute goods suppliers and the small shopkeepers in the alley and streets were integrated and woven into a monopoly and wholesale system.\nRegardless of status, many yangban aristocrats and commoners engaged in some kind of merchant activities. Thus Hanseong made great strides as a commercial and industrial city and hub in the 18th century. The popular demand for handicrafts and goods such as knives, mane hats, dining tables and brassware was ever-increasing. Restrictions on wearing the mane hat originally denoting yangban status, virtually disappeared.\nEven bootlegging of books became commercialised as competition developed among the well-to-do yangban who engaged in the publication of collected literary works by their renowned ancestors. This also led to printing popular fiction and poetry. The people especially appreciated satire and social criticism. One example is the Chunhyangjeon (Tales of Chunghyang) about the fidelity of the gisaeng's daughter, which was widely read as a satire aimed to expose the greed and snobbery of government officials.\n\n\n==== Anti-corruption ====\nThe King is also renowned for having treasured Park Mun-su, whom he appointed as secret royal inspector (Amhaengeosa; \uc554\ud589\uc5b4\uc0ac). Park, who had earned great merit in putting down Yi In-jwa's rebellion in 1728, went around the nation arresting corrupt local officers in the name of the King.\n\n\n==== Catholicism ====\nYeongjo was the first king to take action against Roman Catholic activities in the country. By the 18th century, Catholicism was beginning to acquire a following especially in the Gangwon and Hwanghae provinces. In 1758, Yeongjo officially outlawed Catholicism as an evil practice.\n\n\n=== Crown Prince Sado ===\nThe only significantly dismal incident during Yeongjo's reign was the death of his son, Crown Prince Sado. History indicates Sado suffered from mental illness, randomly killing people in the palace and raping palace maids. Because Yeongjo could not execute his son without also implicating his daughter-in-law and grandson, he ordered Sado to climb into a wooden rice chest on a hot July day in 1762. After two days, King Yeongjo had the chest containing Sado tied with rope, covered with grass, and moved to the upper palace. Sado responded from inside the chest until the night of the seventh day; the chest was opened and he was pronounced dead on the eighth day. During the 19th century, there were rumors that Crown Prince Sado had not been mentally ill, but had been victimised by a court plot. This, however, is contradicted by both the memoirs written by Sado's widow and the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty.\nAs a means to preserve the legitimacy of Sado's son as his own heir, Yeongjo decreed that the boy be registered as the son of the deceased Crown Prince Hyojang and Crown Princess Consort Hyosun.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nYeongjo had lived with poor health for much of his life, and was even infected with parasitic worms. Because of this, he took many precautions to stay healthy, which some speculate may have contributed to his death at a relatively old age.\nFourteen years after Crown Prince Sado's death, his son and Yeongjo's grandson, Yi San (posthumously King Jeongjo), became King. The early part of the new King's years were marked by political intrigues and fear of court officials who were afraid that he would seek revenge on them for petitioning the punishment that caused the death of his father, Crown Prince Sado.\nYeongjo is buried with his second wife, Queen Jeongsun, in the royal tomb of Wonneung (\uc6d0\ub989; \u5143\u9675) in Guri, Gyeonggi Province.\n\n\n== Family ==\nFather: King Sukjong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \uc219\uc885; 7 October 1661 \u2013 12 July 1720)\nGrandfather: King Hyeonjong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \ud604\uc885; 14 March 1641 \u2013 17 September 1674)\nGrandmother: Queen Myeongseong of the Cheongpung Kim clan (\uba85\uc131\uc655\ud6c4 \uae40\uc528; 13 June 1642 \u2013 21 January 1684)\nBiological mother: Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Haeju Choe clan (\uc219\ube48 \ucd5c\uc528; 17 December 1670 \u2013 9 April 1718)\nGrandfather: Choe Hyo-won (\ucd5c\ud6a8\uc6d0; 23 February 1638 \u2013 15 August 1672)\nGrandmother: Lady Hong of the Namyang Hong clan (\ub0a8\uc591 \ud64d\uc528; 1639\u20131673)\nAdoptive mother: Queen Inwon of the Gyeongju Kim clan (\uc778\uc6d0\uc655\ud6c4 \uae40\uc528; 3 November 1687 \u2013 13 May 1757)\nConsort(s) and their respective issue\n\nQueen Jeongseong of the Daegu Seo clan (\uc815\uc131\uc655\ud6c4 \uc11c\uc528; 12 January 1693 \u2013 3 April 1757)\nQueen Jeongsun of the Gyeongju Kim clan (\uc815\uc21c\uc655\ud6c4 \uae40\uc528; 2 December 1745 \u2013 11 February 1805)\nRoyal Noble Consort Jeong of the Hamyang Yi clan (\uc815\ube48 \uc774\uc528; 1694 \u2013 16 November 1721)\nPrincess Hwaeok (\ud654\uc5b5\uc639\uc8fc; 22 April 1717 \u2013 8 April 1718), first daughter\nYi Haeng, Crown Prince Hyojang  (\ud6a8\uc7a5\uc138\uc790 \uc774\ud589; 4 April 1719 \u2013 16 December 1728), first son\nPrincess Hwasun (\ud654\uc21c\uc639\uc8fc; 8 March 1720 \u2013 17 January 1758), second daughter\nRoyal Noble Consort Yeong of the Jeonui Yi clan (\uc601\ube48 \uc774\uc528; 15 August 1696 \u2013 23 August 1764)\nPrincess Hwapyong (\ud654\ud3c9\uc639\uc8fc; 27 April 1727 \u2013 24 June 1748), third daughter\nFourth daughter (3 August 1728 \u2013 18 February 1731)\nFifth daughter (12 December 1729 \u2013 21 March 1731)\nSix daughter (1 January 1732 \u2013 12 April 1736)\nPrincess Hwahyeop (\ud654\ud611\uc639\uc8fc; 7 March 1733 \u2013 27 November 1752), seventh daughter\nYi Seon, Crown Prince Sado (\uc0ac\ub3c4\uc138\uc790 \uc774\uc120; 13 February 1735 \u2013 12 July 1762), second son\nPrincess Hwawan (\ud654\uc644\uc639\uc8fc; 9 March 1738 \u2013 17 May 1808), ninth daughter\nRoyal Consort Gwi-in of the Pungyang Jo clan (\uadc0\uc778 \uc870\uc528; 16 October 1707 \u2013 1780)\nEighth daughter (19 September 1735 \u2013 3 September 1736)\nPrincess Hwayu (\ud654\uc720\uc639\uc8fc; 29 September 1740 \u2013 21 May 1777), tenth daughter\nRoyal Consort Suk-ui of the Nampyeong Mun clan (\uc219\uc758 \ubb38\uc528; ? \u2013 1776)\nPrincess Hwaryeong (\ud654\ub839\uc639\uc8fc; 1753\u20131821), eleventh daughter\nPrincess Hwagil (\ud654\uae38\uc639\uc8fc; 1754\u20131772), twelfth daughter\nCourt Lady Yi (\uc0c1\uad81 \uc774\uc528)\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nPortrayed by Kim Sung-won in the 1988 MBC TV series 500 Years of Joseon: The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong.\nPortrayed by Park Geun-hyung in the 1998 MBC TV series The King's Road.\nPortrayed by Choi Bool-am in the 1998 MBC TV series Hong Guk Young.\nPortrayed by Jo Min-ki in the 2002 MBC TV series Inspector Park Moon So.\nPortrayed by Lee Tae-ri in the 2002\u20133 KBS2 TV series Royal Story: Jang Hui-bin.\nPortrayed by Kim Sung-gyum in the 2007 CGV TV series Eight Days, Assassination Attempts against King Jeongjo.\nPortrayed by Lee Soon-jae in the 2007 MBC TV series Lee San, Wind of the Palace.\nPortrayed by Lee Hyung-suk and Lee Seon-ho in the 2010 MBC TV series Dong Yi.\nPortrayed by Jeon Gook-hwan in the 2011 SBS TV series Warrior Baek Dong-soo.\nPortrayed by Han Suk-kyu in the 2014 SBS TV series Secret Door.\nPortrayed by Yoo Yeon-seok in the 2014 film The Royal Tailor.\nPortrayed by Song Kang-ho in the 2015 film The Throne.\nPortrayed by Yeo Jin-goo in the 2016 SBS TV series The Royal Gambler.\nPortrayed by Ryu Tae-joon in the 2017 film The Age of Blood.\nPortrayed by Jung Il-woo in the 2019 SBS TV series Haechi.\nPortrayed by Lee Deok-hwa in the 2021 MBC TV series The Red Sleeve.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Korea\nList of monarchs of Korea\nDong Yi (TV series)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}}}}
