His father was Crown Prince Hyomyeong, who died at the age of 20 before becoming king, and his mother was Queen Sinjeong of the Pungyang Jo clan.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nYi Hwan was born to Crown Princess Jo and Crown Prince Hyomyeong on 8 September 1827 in Gyeongchunjeon (\uacbd\ucd98\uc804; \u666f\u6625\u6bbf) within Changdeok Palace. It was said that when the day before he was born, she dreamt of giving her son a box containing a tree carved with jade, and on the day of his birth, a group of cranes flew from the front room and went around for a long time. She and the others considered it to be strange.\nThe young Heonjong ascended to the throne in 1834 at the age of 7 after his grandfather, King Sunjo, died. Heonjong was the youngest monarch to ascend the throne in Joseon's history. Like King Sunjo, Heonjong took the throne at a young age and his grandmother, Queen Sunwon served as queen regent. Although King Heonjong ascended to the throne, he had no political control over Joseon. When Heonjong reached adulthood, Queen Sunwon refused to give up control. In 1840, the control over the kingdom was then handed down to the Andong Kim clan, the family of his grandmother Queen Sunwon, following the anti-Catholic Gihae persecution of 1839. During Heonjong's reign, he built the Nakseonjae complex and insisted that his beloved concubine, Kim Gyeong-bin, be given sole use of the complex which was an unprecedented move in Joseon's history.\nKing Heonjong died after reigning for 15 years in 1849 at the age of 21. He was buried at the Gyeongneung tomb within the Donggureung Tomb Cluster in Seoul, where several kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty were buried, with Queen Hyohyeon and Queen Hyojeong. As King Heonjong died without an heir, the throne passed to a distant descendant of King Yeongjo, King Cheoljong.\nAs was customary with the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, the chronicle of Heonjong's reign was compiled after his death, in 1851. The compilation of the 16-volume chronicle was supervised by Jo In-yeong, her mother's uncle.\n\n\n== Family ==\nFather: King Munjo of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \ubb38\uc870; 18 September 1809 \u2013 25 June 1830)\nGrandfather: King Sunjo of Joseon (\uc870\uc120\uc758 \uc21c\uc870; 29 July 1790 \u2013 13 December 1834)\nGrandmother: Queen Sunwon of the Andong Kim clan (\uc21c\uc6d0\uc655\ud6c4 \uae40\uc528; 8 June 1789 \u2013 21 September 1857)\nMother: Queen Sinjeong of the Pungyang Jo clan (\uc2e0\uc815\uc655\ud6c4 \uc870\uc528; 21 January 1809 \u2013 4 June 1890)\nGrandfather: Jo Man-yeong, Internal Prince Pungeun (\ud48d\uc740\ubd80\uc6d0\uad70 \uc870\ub9cc\uc601; 1776\u20131846)\nGrandmother: Internal Princess Consort Deokan of the Eunjin Song clan (\ub355\uc548\ubd80\ubd80\uc778 \uc740\uc9c4 \uc1a1\uc528; 1776\u20131834)\nConsort(s) and their respective issue\n\nQueen Hyohyeon of the Andong Kim clan (\ud6a8\ud604\uc655\ud6c4 \uae40\uc528; 27 April 1828 \u2013 18 October 1843)\nQueen Hyojeong of the Namyang Hong clan (\ud6a8\uc815\uc655\ud6c4 \ud64d\uc528; 6 March 1831 \u2013 2 January 1904)\nRoyal Noble Consort Gyeong of the Gwangsan Kim clan (\uacbd\ube48 \uae40\uc528; 27 August 1832 \u2013 21 April 1907)\nRoyal Noble Consort Jeong of the Haepyeong Yun clan (\uc815\ube48 \uc724\uc528; 1827 \u2013 ?)\nRoyal Consort Suk-ui of the Gimhae Kim clan (\uc219\uc758 \uae40\uc528; January 1814 \u2013 12 November 1895)\nFirst daughter (1848\u20131848)\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nPortrayed by Jung Hae-in in the 2018 film Heung-boo: The Revolutionist.\nThe starting king of Joseon in the video game Victoria 3.\nPortrayed by Nam Da Reum in the 2022 film A Birth.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Rulers of Korea\nJoseon Dynasty\nHistory of Korea\n\n\n== References =="}}}}
