He succeeded to the throne after the deposition of his elder half-brother, the tyrannical Yeonsangun.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Rise to power ===\n\nIn September 1506, on the day Yeonsangun was deposed, soldiers belonging to the coup's leaders surrounded the house of Grand Prince Jinseong. He was about to commit suicide, thinking that his older half-brother was finally going to kill him, but after being dissuaded by his wife, Lady Shin (later known as Queen Dangyeong), Grand Prince Jinseong found himself becoming the eleventh king of Joseon.\n\n\n=== Jo Gwang-jo's reforms ===\nJungjong worked hard to wipe out the remnants of Yeonsangun's era by reopening Sungkyunkwan (the royal university) and the Office of Censors (which criticizes inappropriate actions of the king). However, during the early days of his reign, the new king could not exert the royal power freely as those who put him on the throne held immense control over the country. When three of the main leaders of coup died of old age or natural causes in the next eight years, Jungjong began to assert his authority and carried out large-scale reforms with the help of Jo Gwang-jo and other Sarim scholars, despite much opposition from conservative nobles who had participated in the 1506 rebellion.\nJo Gwang-jo strengthened local autonomy by establishing a self-governing system called Hyangyak, promoted Confucian writings by translating them into hangul (Korean native script) and distributing them widely, pursued a land reform that would distribute land more equally between the rich and poor, and introduced a supplementary system to recruit talents for the government. He believed that any talented people, including slaves, should be appointed as officials regardless of social status. The Annals of the Joseon dynasty state that during his time as Inspector General (Daesaheon; \ub300\uc0ac\ud5cc), he enforced the laws strictly so that no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the local populace.\nWhile Jungjong and Jo Gwang-jo shared a common passion for the reformist agenda, the former was chiefly interested in solidifying royal authority whereas the latter was more concerned with neo-Confucian ideology, according to which those who rule must be a virtuous example to the rest. Jo's uncompromising character and frequent remonstrations also began to irritate the king.\nIn late 1519, the conservative officials came up with a plan to further weaken Jo Gwang-jo's influence; they used honey to write Ju Cho Wi Wang (\"Ju Cho will be King\"; \uc8fc\ucd08\uc704\uc655, \u8d70\u8096\u7232\u738b) on mulberry leaves so that caterpillars would leave behind the same words as if in supernatural manifestation. When the hanja characters \u8d70 (ju) and \u8096 (cho) are put together, they form the character \u8d99 (jo), and the expression's meaning changes to \"Jo [Gwang-jo] will be King\". The incident was reminiscent of another occurrence that took place before the fall of the Goryeo dynasty, when the phrase Mok Ja Deuk Guk (\"Son of wood will gain the country\"; \ubaa9\uc790\ub4dd\uad6d, \u6728\u5b50\u5f97\u570b) became popular. In this case, the combined characters \u6728 (\"wood\") and \u5b50 (\"son\") form the character  \u674e (\"yi\"), which was the surname of General Yi Seong-gye (later known as King Taejo, the founder of Joseon).\nThe only living leader of the 1506 coup, Hong Gyeong-ju (\ud64d\uacbd\uc8fc; \u6d2a\u666f\u821f), used this event to heighten Jungjong's suspicions and fears. Finally, in January 1520, Jo Gwang-jo was executed on charges of factionalism and many of his followers were exiled, while his radical reform programs were abruptly abandoned. The incident became known as the Third Literati Purge (Gimyo Sahwa; \uae30\ubb18\uc0ac\ud654, \u5df1\u536f\u58eb\u798d).\n\n\n=== Rule of in-laws ===\nAfter Jo Gwang-jo's elimination, Jungjong never had the chance to rule on his own again. His reign was marked by tumultuous struggle among various conservative factions, each of them backed by one of the king's wives or concubines.\nIn 1524, Nam Gon and Shim Jung ousted the corrupt official Kim Allo, but he managed to return to power and took revenge by accusing Royal Noble Consort Gyeong (one of the king's concubines) of plotting against the crown prince, which led to her execution along with her only son, Prince Bokseong. Following this case, Kim Allo started using the protection of the crown prince as an excuse to begin a reign of terror against his enemies, and even attempted to depose Jungjong's third wife, Queen Munjeong, after she gave birth to a son (the future King Myeongjong). He eventually met his downfall at the hands of the queen's brothers, Yun Won-ro and Yun Won-hyeong. Despite these events, Yun Im, older brother of the late Queen Janggyeong and an ally of Kim Allo, was able to maintain his standing and preserve his nephew's position as heir to the throne.\nThe scholars and officials now gathered around two new centers of power and each group developed into separate political factions. Yun Im's party became known as \"Greater Yun\" and the Yun brothers' party as  \"Lesser Yun\". Their conflict caused the Fourth Literati Purge (Ulsa Sahwa; \uc744\uc0ac\uc0ac\ud654, \u4e59\u5df3\u58eb\u798d) after Jungjong's death.\nAs the royal court was weakened by the continual internal conflict, foreign powers driven away by earlier monarchs returned with much greater effect. Japanese pirates often plundered the southern coastal regions, while the Jurchens attacked the northern frontier numerous times, bleeding the army dry.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nThe king died on 9 December 1544 and was originally buried in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province. He was later moved to the Seonjeongneung Cluster, in Seoul, the burial ground of his parents, King Seongjong and Queen Jeonghyeon. The tomb is called Jeongneung (\uc815\ub989).\nThe throne passed to his eldest legitimate son, Crown Prince Yi Ho (posthumously honored as King Injong), who died without issue less than a year later and was succeeded by his younger half-brother, Grand Prince Gyeongwon (today known as King Myeongjong).\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nFather: King Seongjong of Joseon (\uc870\uc120 \uc131\uc885;
