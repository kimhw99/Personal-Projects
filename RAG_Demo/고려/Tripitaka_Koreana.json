They are currently located at the Buddhist temple Haeinsa, in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is the oldest intact version of Buddhist canon in Hanja script. It contains 1,496 titles, divided into 6,568 books, spanning 81,258 pages, for a total 52,330,152 Hanja characters. It is often called the Palman Daejanggyeong (\"Eighty-thousand Tripitaka\") due to the number of the printing plates that comprise it. It is also known as the Goryeo Daejanggyeong (Goryeo dynasty Tripitaka).\nEach wood block (page) measures 24 centimetres in height and 70 centimetres (9.4 in \u00d7 27.6 in) in length. The thickness of the blocks ranges from 2.6 to 4 centimetres (1.0\u20131.6 in) and each weighs about three to four kilograms (6.61 - 8.81 lbs). The woodblocks would be almost as tall as Paektu Mountain at 2.74 km (1.70 mi) if stacked and would measure 60 km (37 mi) long if lined up, and weigh 280 tons in total. The woodblocks are in pristine condition without warping or deformation despite being created more than 750 years ago.\nThe Tripi\u1e6daka was designated a National Treasure of South Korea in 1962, and inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World international register in 2007. Historically the Tripi\u1e6daka was closed except for Buddhist events and scholars but 2021 it was opened to members of the public who preregister.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThere is a movement by scholars to change the English name of the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana. Professor Robert Buswell Jr., a leading scholar of Korean Buddhism, called for the renaming of the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana to the Korean Buddhist Canon, indicating that the current nomenclature is misleading because the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana is much greater in scale than the actual Tripi\u1e6daka, and includes much additional content such as travelogues, Sanskrit and Chinese dictionaries, and biographies of monks and nuns.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name Goryeo Tripi\u1e6daka comes from \"Goryeo\", the name of Korea from the 10th to the 14th centuries.\nWork on the first Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana began in 1011 during the Goryeo\u2013Khitan War and was completed in 1087. Choi's Goryeo Military Regime, which moved the capital to Ganghwa Island due to Mongol invasions, set up a temporary organization called \"Daejang Dogam\".\nThe act of carving the woodblocks was considered to be a way of bringing about a change in fortune by invoking the Buddha's help. The first Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana was based primarily on the Kaibao Canon completed in the 10th century, but other scriptures published until then, such as the Khitan Tripi\u1e6daka, were also consulted in order to identify items in need of revision and adjustment. The first Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana contained around 6,000 volumes.\nThe original set of woodblocks was destroyed by fire during the Mongol invasions of Korea in 1232, when Goryeo's capital was moved to Ganghwa Island during nearly three decades of Mongol incursions, although scattered parts of its prints still remain. To once again implore divine assistance with combating the Mongol threat, King Gojong thereafter ordered the revision and re-creation of the Tripi\u1e6daka; the carving began in 1237 and was completed in 12 years, with support from Ch'oe U and his son Ch'oe Hang, and involving monks from both the Seon and Gyo schools. This second version is usually what is meant by the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana. In 1398, it was moved to Haeinsa, where it has remained housed in four buildings.\nThe production of the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana was an enormous national commitment of money and manpower, according to Robert Buswell Jr., perhaps comparable to the US 1960s Apollo program Moon landings. Thousands of scholars and craftsmen were employed in this massive project.\n\n\n== Evaluation and Significance ==\nThe Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana is the 32nd National Treasure of South Korea, and Haeinsa, the depository for the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana, has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The UNESCO committee describes the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana as \"one of the most important and most complete corpus of Buddhist doctrinal texts in the world\". Not only is the work invaluable, it is also aesthetically valuable and shows a high quality of workmanship. Currently, the Palman Daejanggyeong is one of the three woodblocks in the world that are registered on UNESCO.\nThe Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana is stored in Haeinsa temple. While most of the wood blocks have remained in pristine condition for more than 750 years, a few were damaged when a new depository was built in the early 1970s (by the Park Chung Hee regime) and few blocks were transplanted to the new building on a trial basis. Those blocks were damaged almost immediately. They were subsequently moved back to their initial spots and the new building was shut down. That building is now the 'Zen Center'. Currently there are ongoing debates as to the quality of the current storage area.\nThe historical value of the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana comes from the fact that it is the most complete and accurate extant collection of Buddhist treatises, laws, and scriptures. It is a popular misconception that the Tripitaka Koreana does not contain a single error; a survey found that the text does indeed have missing characters and errors. The compilers of the Korean version incorporated older Northern Song Chinese, Khitan, and Goryeo versions, and added content written by respected Korean monks. Contemporary scholars are able to conduct research about the older Chinese and Khitan versions of the Tripi\u1e6daka using the Korean version. The quality of the wood blocks is attributed to the National Preceptor Sugi, the Buddhist monk in charge of the project, who carefully checked the Korean version for errors. Upon completing the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana, Sugi published 30 volumes of Additional Records which recorded errors, redundancies, and omissions he found during his comparisons of the different versions of the Tripi\u1e6daka. Because of the relative completion of the Korea edition of the Chinese Buddhist Tripitaka, the Japanese Taisho edition of the Tripi\u1e6daka was said also to have been based on the Korean edition. Some of the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana's texts were even used in the Chinese edition of Zhonghua dazangjing which was based on the Jin edition which in turn was a sister edition sent to Korea.\nThe Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana was one of the most coveted items among Japanese Buddhists in the Edo period. Japan never managed to create a woodblock Tripi\u1e6daka, and made constant requests and attempts to acquire the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana from Korea since 1388. 45 complete printings of the Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana were gifted to Japan since the Muromachi period. The Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana was used as the basis for the modern Japanese Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka.\n\nEach block was made of birch wood from the southern islands of Korea and treated to prevent the decay of the wood. The blocks were soaked in sea water for three years, then cut and boiled in salt water. Next, the blocks were placed in the shade and exposed to the wind for three years, at which point they were ready to be carved. After each block was carved, it was coated in a poisonous lacquer to keep insects away and then framed with metal to prevent warping.\nEvery block was inscribed with 23 lines of text with 14 characters per line. Therefore, each block, counting both sides, contained a total of 644 characters. The consistency of the style - and some external sources - led people to believe that a single man carved the entire collection, but it is now estimated that a team of 30 men carved the Tripi\u1e6daka.\n\n\n== Modern edition ==\nThe modern edition has 1514 texts in 47 volumes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWoodblock printing in Korea\nEarly Buddhist Texts\nPali Canon\nTaish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka\nJingo-ji Tripi\u1e6daka\nTripi\u1e6daka tablets at Kuthodaw Pagoda\nGandh\u0101ran Buddhist texts\nBuddhist texts\nBuddhism in Korea\nNational treasures of South Korea\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Cited works ==\nKeown, Damien; Prebish, Charles S., eds.
